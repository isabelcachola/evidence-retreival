The Qatar delegation had participated also in the eighth session of the WHO Framework Convention for Tobacco Control (FCTC), which concluded in Geneva on Saturday. Communications officer on the FCTC Dr Kholoud al Mutawa, who is also Head of the Non-Communicable Diseases department in the Ministry of Public Health, reviewed the positive developments and achievements of the countries of the Eastern Mediterranean region in the area of tobacco control and the challenges faced by some states in controlling this practice. She noted that five countries in the region have joined the Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products during the current year, expressing the hope that more states will join the protocol in the coming period. She highlighted that the region's countries are facing a major challenge in keeping tobacco control a top priority in the face of the other challenges they have to deal with, especially as a large group of countries are facing emergencies or are recovering from a previous emergency. She maintained, however, that the ministries of health are pushing the tobacco control agenda forward.

They placed makeshift ashtrays, really just upside-down seashells, next to their beach chairs, storing discarded cigars there. Two from the group - Monica Plumley, 48, of Glassboro, and Shelley Gatanis, 50, of Woodstown - had just met each other that day, and bonded over cigars.  "I want to be able to do anything that's appropriate freely," Plumley said of their right to smoke on the sand. "I keep it all in my little area. . . . I put it in a neat little pile, pick it up and take it up for trash."  "If they're going to smoke, they're going to smoke," added Gatanis' father, Doug Hopkins, 72, visiting from Appling, Ga. He, like Plumley, had a cigar in hand and puffs of smoke coming from his mouth.  There is no smoking ban on Atlantic City beaches, and much to smokers' relief, there won't be at any time soon.  After New Jersey lawmakers approved a bill that would ban smoking in all public parks and beaches in the state, Gov. Christie last month issued a conditional veto and instead offered to support a smoking ban solely on state-owned parks and beaches. The legislature must act on that proposal.  The bill vetoed by Christie would have expanded the New Jersey Smoke Free Air Act, which banned smoking in all indoor public spaces, to include every public park and beach. This essentially would make the state's entire 130-mile coastline - beaches from Sandy Hook to Cape May - smoke-free. The bill would also allow for beaches to establish designated smoking areas.  "I abhor smoking," Christie wrote in the veto. "But I continue to believe that the state should not impose its will upon our local governments, and instead continue to leave it up to towns and counties whether to ban smoking in their parks and beaches."  In 2014, Christie vetoed a similar bill that aimed to ban smoking on all public parks and beaches. This time, he offered changes to the bill instead of shutting it down completely, and mentioned that several local governments have imposed their own smoking bans.  Several New Jersey beaches have taken that matter into their own hands, as the veto language suggests. According to the America Nonsmoker's Rights Foundation, 15 beaches in New Jersey have implemented smoke-free beach laws.  Some beaches along Long Beach Island, for example, have implemented a smoking ban, including Long Beach Township and now Beach Haven, whose smoking ban went into effect on June 8.  "The mayor and council felt a responsibility to protect young children from secondhand smoke," said Beach Haven Municipal Clerk Sherry Mason. "They didn't want to wait."  Mason said the town had been discussing the ban and were waiting to see what the state would do, but the township came to the decision in April to prepare for the current beach season. This came two years after nearby Long Beach Township also implemented a ban on smoking along the beach.  Mason said beach rakes had been picking up a lot of cigarette butts, and this measure would help with that as beach seasons continue.  Denise Glass, 35, of Bordentown, said she frequently comes to LBI with her 3-year-old son. She's against smoking on the beach, and would take banned areas into consideration when choosing a place to go.  "It's just bad for you," she said. "I'm in support of a ban."  But not all jurisdictions along Long Beach Island have banned smoking. Surf City Mayor Francis Hodgson said after watching the governor's decision, the township does not intend to ban smoking on the beach.  "We discussed it, and the council and myself feel as though this is a family resort and a summer resort," he said. "People come away to relax and enjoy themselves - if a guy wants to sit on the beach and smoke a cigar, let him go."  While Hodgson said he doesn't smoke and does not enjoy the smell of it, the township doesn't want to "deprive somebody else of their enjoyment."  He said there have not been many problems with complaints about smokers on the beach, but he did say there have been some people who inquire about it. As of now, he said, he thinks it would be a challenge to enforce a ban.  Further down the shore, Ocean City has had a smoking ban along its boardwalk since 2014. While there is no ban on the beach, Doug Bergen, the city's public information officer, said he could see the administration discussing a law for the future, perhaps for the next summer season.  Lisa Ambrosino, 47, of Mount Laurel, came to visit Ocean City and lit up a cigarette while on the beach. She said she always cleans up her cigarette butts and makes an effort to avoid causing problems for others around her.  "It's my decision," she said, with a cigarette in hand. "We're outside. I understand secondhand smoke, but we're outside."  New Jersey Sierra Club director Jeff Tittel said he believes Christie is "sacrificing" the health and safety of people on the beach with the veto, considering secondhand smoke and potentially lit cigarettes buried in the sand.  "This is a health issue, and it's an important one. What our governor did was just wrong," he said. "We shouldn't be OK with turning our beaches into ashtrays."  Cora Rosenhaft, 41, of Damascus, Md., often visits Ocean City and was on vacation recently. She said she doesn't enjoy it when others smoke on the beach but understands that people want to.  "I prefer it when it isn't around," she said. "But it hasn't been a big problem while we're here."  Back in Atlantic City, cigarette butts were scattered throughout the Boardwalk and cigarette discard stations sat above the beach line on the boards.  Plumley, smoking a cigar while standing on the sand, said she wouldn't support a smoking ban on beaches and thinks the responsibility lies on those who are smoking to clean up and not bother nonsmokers. She said she "can't stand" people who don't clean up after themselves.  Assemblywoman Valerie Vainieri Huttle (D., Bergen), a primary sponsor of the bill, said she thinks it's not enough, though. When a new governor takes office, Huttle said, they will try to pass the bill again.  "I was hoping that the outcome would be different this session," Huttle said. "A uniform policy makes much more sense and, quite frankly, it protects the residents more equally."  Still, Huttle said she expects the amended bill to pass.  "It's better than nothing," she said. "I don't think we'll let this one go."	bing	15 beaches in New Jersey have implemented smoke-free beach laws

It requires the packaging of liquid nicotine containers to be subject to existing child poisoning prevention packaging standards. Child-resistant caps on e-liquid products were already the law in 15 states, and child-resistant packaging is also a requirement for members of the American E-Liquid Manufacturing Standards Association.  One teaspoon of liquid nicotine is potentially lethal to a child, according to the American Association of Poison Control Centers. In 2014, poison control centers reported 3,783 e-cigarette and liquid nicotine exposure cases, over half involving children under age 6. In December 2014, a 1-year-old boy in New York died after ingesting liquid nicotine.  Under the law, which the President signed last week, liquid nicotine can only be sold in child-resistant bottles and containers that meet the same standards as other potentially poisonous household substances, as set forth in the Poison Prevention Packaging Act of 1970.  The American Vaping Association and tobacco harm reduction and smoking cessation groups all agree that child-resistant packaging is needed and regulation was needed to prevent “bad actors” in the marketplace from putting kids at risk.  The law excludes sealed, pre-filled, and disposable containers that are inserted directly into an electronic cigarette.	bing	President Barack Obama signed S. 142, the “Child Nicotine Poisoning Prevention Act of 2015,” which was introduced a year ago by Senator Bill Nelson (D-Florida), Senator Kelly Ayotte (R-New Hampshire), and 20 other U.S. senators.

Those who vape have been asked by authorities, including Gov. Kate Brown, to voluntarily stop vaping. By Sam Stites - Oregon Capital BureauSeptember 28, 2019 at 5:08am Oregon State Capitol, governor's office (Salem Reporter/file) SALEM -- The Oregon Health Authority is recommending that Gov. Kate Brown ban for six months the display and sale of all vaping products, both nicotine and cannabis based. The recommendation is one of six related to curtailing use of vaping products across the state and comes after state officials, including the governor, urged consumers to voluntarily stop using vaping products. Brown has asked the state Justice Department to review the options before she takes executive action. The governor sought the health agency’s recommendations following the announcement Thursday of the second Oregon death related to vaping. State officials gave no indication when a ban might take effect, but Health Authority officials said such a ban should remain in place while federal agencies investigate vape-related illnesses. “The safety of this product has been in question for a long time,” Dr. Dean Sidelinger, state health officer, told reporters during a Sept. 26 press conference. “We know this product is not safe and have seen health effects from it with acute respiratory injuries and death. We do urge all individuals to stop vaping whether that’s nicotine-based products, cannabis products or other. People who haven’t vaped, shouldn’t start.” The Health Authority’s recommendations included improving access to federally -approved methods to quit smoking. The agency also proposes providing eight weeks of free nicotine-replacement therapy “without barriers,” according to an agency statement. The Health Authority also suggests that the state urge the FDA to regulate vaping products and establish a ban on internet sales of tobacco and online marketing of vaping products. The agency also wants health care providers to continue reporting cases of acute respiratory injury related to vaping so the state can compile data and establish a better understanding its health effects. Finally, the Health Authority recommended Brown create a workgroup of health professionals and government leaders to develop additional recommendations to address what the state now considers a crisis. “Our office will be working closely with DOJ, the OHA, and other relevant state agencies to determine a path forward under Oregon law that protects the public health of all Oregonians when it comes to vaping products,” the governor said in a statement. State health officials have so far identified five cases of acute respiratory illness related to vaping both nicotine-based products and cannabis products. The state’s first death related to vaping was announced Sept. 3. According to Sidelinger, the five patients who were hospitalized reported shortness of breath and trouble breathing, which progressed. More than 800 cases of vaping-related illness have been reported across the nation. There have been a dozen deaths reported in several states. “The latest individual who died, like the other case, was an adult, and did report using cannabis products,” said Sidelinger, who couldn’t provide more detailed information about the victim. Sidelinger said that the five people being treated had used licensed cannabis products. The Health Authority expects more cases to be reported. Dr. Jennifer Vines, Multnomah County deputy health officer, said her county sent a report to several hundred Portland-area health care providers echoing Sidelinger’s warning. The county also urged people to quit vaping and asked health care providers to watch for more cases. The warning came days after Multnomah County commissioners said they would work with state and federal officials to ban the sale of flavored nicotine products.	google	The county also urged people to quit vaping and asked health care providers to watch for more cases.

WHO data show a steep rise in smoking in many African countries, with many 5-year projected increases at 5% and more.i A proven public health strategy, harm reduction refers to policies, regulations, and actions that reduce health risks by providing safer forms of hazardous products or encouraging less risky behaviors, rather than simply banning them. Partnering with the information dissemination project, Tobacco Harm Reduction Malawi, and the newly launched Campaign for Safer Alternativesbased in Kenya, the GSTHR report’s publishers presented global findings on tobacco harm reduction, showing that many smokers have switched to safer products and dramatically reduced the risks associated with smoking. “We need to halt the dramatic rises in smoking rates in Africa which are predicted by WHO,” asserted Professor Gerry Stimson, Director of Knowledge∙Action∙Change and Emeritus Professor at Imperial College London. “Most smokers want to quit smoking, but they find it hard to stop using nicotine. Around the world, millions of lives depend on both consumer and government acceptance of safer alternatives to smoking.” Chimwemwe Ngoma, Project Manager, Tobacco Harm Reduction Malawi and holder of a Global Tobacco Harm Reduction Scholarship, declared: “Tobacco Harm Reduction Malawi believes that all citizens of Malawi should be informed of the health consequences, addictive nature, and mortal threat posed by tobacco consumption and exposure to tobacco smoke. Malawians should be able to make more informed public and personal choices, including having access to safer nicotine products, to enable them to live longer and healthier lives.” Joseph Magero, Chair of the Campaign for Safer Alternatives and holder of a Global Tobacco Harm Reduction Scholarship, noted: “Society’s relationship with tobacco and nicotine is changing due to developments in technology, such as vapes and other safer nicotine products. The Campaign for Safer Alternatives has formally launched this week to ensure more people across East Africa receive accurate information on alternatives to smoking. By arming people with information, we can finally begin to curb the tobacco epidemic.” The No Fire, No Smoke – Global State of Tobacco Harm Reduction 2018 report and this press release are published by Knowledge∙Action∙Change, a private sector public health agency based in the United Kingdom. i The graphic entitled African region – increasing daily tobacco prevalence trends can be downloaded and reproduced with credit to GSTHR at https://gsthr.org/images/charts/chapter2/2.5.jpgii March 13-14, 2019, Golden Peacock Hotel, Lilongwe, Malawi.

Prawitr Sae Wa Ni/EyeEm / Getty Images Originally published on May 9, 2018 3:20 pm You might be breathing chemical residue from tobacco smoke in indoor spaces where no one has smoked for years. This was the surprise finding of a new study published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances. Researchers at Drexel University in Philadelphia found that chemicals left on clothing, furniture and other surfaces by tobacco smoke – known as thirdhand smoke — can become airborne and travel through a building's ventilation system. The researchers measured the air composition in a non-smoking, unoccupied classroom over the course of a month using an aerosol mass spectrometer. They initially wanted to see what happens to outdoor air particles when they come inside. But they kept noticing a chemical signature that was only indoors and not outdoors. They discovered it consisted of chemicals from thirdhand smoke — and made up 29 percent of the air mass in the room. "To add that much additional mass through one type of process is pretty large," says Peter DeCarlo, associate professor of environmental engineering and chemistry at Drexel and lead author on the study. "We didn't expect this at all." DeCarlo and his team looked into the mechanism that would allow compounds from tobacco smoke to end up in a room that hadn't allowed smoking in at least 20 to 25 years. What they discovered was that thirdhand smoke compounds were effectively hitching a ride on tiny particles in the air. The classroom they studied happened to be 20 meters down the hall from a balcony where people would sneak out for an unauthorized smoke. The room was also located near an office space where several smokers worked; that space shares the same HVAC system as the classroom in question. Though they could not identify the exact source, the researchers suspect the thirdhand smoke from these smokers made its way into the classroom and stuck to surfaces there. The compounds were then exposed to another chemical — possibly ammonia from people's breath or skin, or even cleaning products — and became gaseous again. "The chemistry of this is very interesting," says Neal Benowitz, professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco and a leader of the California Consortium on Thirdhand Smoke. He says scientists have known for some time that the nicotine levels in walls and furniture can persist for years. "What this study shows is that thirdhand smoke moves around the room," he says. The Drexel researchers suggest that after becoming gaseous again, smoke residue compounds can attach themselves to tiny air particles that come inside through a building's HVAC system, which in summer months pulls in outside air and chills it. That cooling process condenses water vapor in the air, which primes those outside particles — which can come from everything from car exhaust to power plant emissions — to react with thirdhand smoke gasses. Once the chemicals attach themselves to the air particles, the building's air distribution carries those chemicals throughout the building, including to the classroom researchers studied. All this means people could be unwittingly exposed to thirdhand smoke in higher volumes than previously thought — even in locations where smoking has been verboten for years. The Drexel researchers took their measurements in August 2014, at a time when the building's air conditioning unit was in heavy use. They confirmed the findings in the lab, and repeated the experiment in August 2016 with the same results. However, when they repeated the experiment in winter months, they found no thirdhand smoke compounds in the room, showing that the cooling of outside air was key for their uptake into the air. There aren't good data on the health effects of thirdhand smoke on humans. Studies have shown liver problems and metabolic issues in mice, but the area of study is relatively new when compared to the more established literature on secondhand smoke, for which the level of exposure to harmful chemicals is much greater than thirdhand smoke. However, Benowitz added, secondhand smoke exposure is usually limited to the time a smoker is in the room — a matter of minutes. "With thirdhand smoke, there is a constant source of exposure, day after day after day," he says. The findings could lead to further research on thirdhand smoke exposure from e-cigarettes. They don't contain many of the toxic chemicals produced by combustible cigarettes, but do contain nicotine, which can become airborne. DeCarlo hopes to do future studies on the impact both of vaping and of thirdhand smoke uptake in the home, where the ventilation systems are different than the ones used in commercial and office buildings. "Certainly I think this [study] needs to be considered when we think about how we are keeping our nonsmoking spaces as smoke-free as possible," he says. "How exactly it's combatted I think is going to be up for debate." Benowitz is currently looking for biomarkers to measure how much thirdhand smoke exposure a person has had. That will help with future studies about the exact impact thirdhand smoke has on humans. "It's difficult to study due to the overlap between secondhand smoke and thirdhand smoke," he says. But he adds, "It's certainly a concern and explains how people can be exposed to these chemicals even when they aren't regularly around smokers."

7	3fd3e298-b311-3bc5-9e2a-02ab7faf11fb	Nicotine chemistry, metabolism, kinetics and biomarkers.	Nicotine underlies tobacco addiction, influences tobacco use patterns, and is used as a pharmacological aid to smoking cessation. The absorption, distribution and disposition characteristics of nicotine from tobacco and medicinal products are reviewed. Nicotine is metabolized primarily by the liver enzymes CYP2A6, UDPglucuronosyltransferase (UGT), and flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO). In addition to genetic factors, nicotine metabolism is influenced by diet and meals, age, sex, use of estrogen-containing hormone preparations, pregnancy and kidney disease, other medications, and smoking itself. Substantial racial/ethnic differences are observed in nicotine metabolism, which are likely influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. The most widely used biomarker of nicotine intake is cotinine, which may be measured in blood, urine, saliva, hair, or nails. The current optimal plasma cotinine cut-point to distinguish smokers from non-smokers in the general US population is 3 ng ml(-1). This cut-point is much lower than that established 20 years ago, reflecting less secondhand smoke exposure due to clear air policies and more light or occasional smoking.	bing

The decision has been welcomed by the BMA’s Welsh Council, who said it makes Wales a ‘world leader’ in public health policy.  The wide-ranging Public Health (Wales) Billwas voted through by Assembly Members on Tuesday 16 May. In addition to banning smoking in certain places, it prohibits tobacco and nicotine products from being handed to under 18s by home delivery or collection services, and will see the creation of a national register of tobacco/nicotine retailers.  The Bill also passes the following points into law:  Creating a mandatory licensing scheme for ‘special procedures’, namely acupuncture, body piercing, electrolysis and tattooing, and prohibiting the intimate piercing of anybody under the age of 18  Placing a duty on local authorities to prepare and publish a local toilets strategy, including an assessment of the need for toilets for public use and details of how that need will be met  Requiring public bodies in Wales to assess how their decisions will affect people’s physical and mental health  Making the planning of pharmacy services more responsive to the needs of local communities  Placing a duty on the Welsh government to produce a national strategy on preventing and reducing obesity.  Dr Phil Banfield, chair of the BMA’s Welsh Council, welcomed the decision: “This legislation positions Wales as a world leader in the application public health policy.”  He added that the bill “highlights the importance of taking a proactive and joined-up approach to tackling the causes of obesity and measures that can be taken to reduce them.”  In the run up to the vote, Minister for Social Services and Public Health Rebecca Evans said: “The Public Health (Wales) Bill is the latest in a long line of measures the Welsh government has introduced to improve the health and wellbeing of the people of Wales.  “It has a particular focus on promoting children and younger people’s health. Proposals such as the ban on smoking in school grounds, childcare settings and playgrounds are intended to prevent children from being exposed to smoking behaviours, making it less likely that they’ll take up smoking themselves.”  Contents  Quick Links  Help and Info  Communications International Group  The largest, most experienced publisher in the UK pharmacy sector  CIG is the UK's leading provider of sector-specific news and training, publishing 15 healthcare and beauty titles including Pharmacy Magazine, Training Matters, P3, Independent Community Pharmacist and Beauty Magazine.

While cigarette smoking has fallen to record lows in recent years due to a raft of tobacco control laws and gruesome yet effective public information campaigns, advocates and officials warn Hawaii and the nation remain in the grips of a “vaping epidemic” among high school students and young adults. “We saw our state being one of the best in tobacco use in youth – in 20 years, a lot of that has been eroded by vaping,” said Pedro Haro, executive director of the American Lung Association in Hawaii. “The new generation of adult tobacco users could be really astronomical in the cost of disease and death to the state.” The American Lung Association released its 2022 tobacco control report card for Hawaii, with scores ranging from an A for smoke-free air to an F for limiting flavored tobacco. Courtesy: Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids/2021 The 20th annual “State of Tobacco Control” report, published Wednesday, examines the tobacco use policies of all 50 states and the District of Columbia, giving letter grades in five categories: smoke-free air, program funding, tobacco taxes, quitting services and flavor restrictions. Hawaii was early to ban smoking in most public areas, Haro said, including in restaurants and bars, government and private workplaces, state parks and within 20 feet of entrances, exits and air vents, and very much deserves its lone A grade, Haro said. “The state really had a comprehensive law established back in 2006,” Haro said. “There’s very few people that are exposed to secondhand smoke through their work, which is really the foresight of legislators and advocates at the time bringing this forward.” But despite its early success investing in smoke-free air and being the first state to raise the legal smoking age to 21, Hawaii has largely failed to prevent a new generation of teenagers from riding the wave of e-cigarettes, Haro said. Driven by viral “vape” brands such as Juul, Vuse and NJOY, e-cigarettes have exploded in popularity since the 2010s. Lured by kid-friendly flavors with names like Frozen Lime Drop and Hawaiian POG — a take on island-favorite Passion Orange Guava — rates of vaping among Hawaii high school students tripled from 10% in 2013 to 33% in 2019, according to the Hawaii Youth Tobacco Survey. Hawaii high school vaping rates of 10% were more than double the 4.5% national average in 2013, although mainland numbers have since caught up, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System. There are flavorless and tobacco-scented e-cigarettes available, but youth overwhelmingly choose the fun flavors. Of the 85% of young U.S. users who opted for flavored vapes in 2021, the FDA found 72% frequented the fruity flavors, while around 30% reported using the candy/dessert, mint and menthol flavors, respectively. Flavored e-cigarettes are still readily available in-stores and online, as in this screenshot of Sand Island based e-cigarette shop Volcano’s website. Screenshot/2022 Yet despite this data, Hawaii currently has no law to target youth vaping by regulating the sale of flavored e-cigarettes, resulting in its failing grade in the ALA report card. This is not for lack of trying – in the 2021 legislative session alone, lawmakers introduced at least six bills banning flavored tobacco from stores, in whole or in part. Five died in committee; the last, House Bill 826, made it through the House before the Senate amended it to exempt menthol-flavored tobacco products. House lawmakers disagreed, and the measure died. “I know the conventional wisdom would say, ‘let’s get rid of the pineapple and the juicy fruits or whatever, obviously, child targeting flavors,’” Haro said. “But the data shows that menthol is one of the most preferred flavors for youth, including Hawaii.” There are federal limits on certain flavored tobacco products, however, regulations are patchwork in nature and riddled with loopholes. For example, a Trump-era Food and Drug Administration policy banned most flavors of cartridge-based e-cigarettes but stopped short of curtailing flavors for disposable and other e-cigarette varieties. Today, disposable e-cigarette line Puff Bar has become the favorite brand among youth, and flavored vapes and vape-refills remain readily available online and in-stores, a December 2021 Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids report found, leaving space for state-level intervention. “States and cities cannot wait for the FDA and must act now to close the gaps left by the FDA in order to fully protect kids,” the report wrote. While the e-cigarette industry and some public health experts maintain that vaping helps smokers quit the more-toxic cigarettes and, therefore, needs less regulation, opponents have pointed to signs of long-term lung illness and the potential for e-cigarettes to act as a “gateway” to nicotine addiction, especially among younger users. In a 2016 survey of adult Hawaii e-cigarette users, 40% of respondents reported they had never smoked cigarettes before vaping. Another 21% continued to smoke regularly, while 12% said they started using cigarettes after they began vaping. Besides its bookend-scores for limiting secondhand smoke and flavored tobacco, the ALA gave Hawaii a C for the taxes the state levees on various tobacco products and a C in its funding of tobacco control programs, with the state allocating just 62.6% of the $13.7 million recommended by the CDC, which calculates the amount according to the number of smokers in the state. The state fared better in public access to tobacco cessation services, receiving a B for a well-funded tobacco quit line and treatment covered by the state’s Med-Quest Medicaid plan. The primary issue, Haro said, was the absence of a state mandate requiring private insurers to pay for these services. “We just need that initial leadership to show again,” Haro said. “We need that initial spark to pass the legislation, allow the advocates to work with the communities to … finally see those tobacco numbers reduce.” Sign up for our FREE morning newsletter Sorry.

10	31457088-9f62-3cd1-891f-6723bb3f62cb	NEWS: Report: Industry Targeting Continues to Harm the Black Community	April 9th, 2021 The Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids released a report in February explaining how the targeted marketing of menthol products by the tobacco industry has harmed Black communities. Tobacco industry targeting through marketing, event sponsorships, and retail promotions has caused smoking rates of menthol cigarettes among Black Americans to climb consistently for 60+ years. Menthol cigarettes are even more harmful than other cigarettes, in part due to the fact that menthol masks the harsh taste of tobacco and is easier to inhale deeply. This has led to more young people using menthol, a more intense addiction, and even more difficulty quitting.. Tobacco use, specifically menthol products, is a major contributor to three leading causes of death among Black Americans: heart disease, cancer and stroke. The report also includes the following key findings: In the 1950s, less than 10% of Black people who smoke used menthol cigarettes; today, 85% of Black people who smoke use menthol. Menthol cigarettes continue to be heavily advertised, widely available, and priced cheaper in Black communities. The cooling mint flavor of menthol numbs the throat and reduces the harshness of tobacco smoke, making menthol cigarettes more appealing and easier to use.As a result, menthol cigarettes increase the number of youth and young adults who experiment with cigarettes and become smokers. Young people who start smoking menthol cigarettes are more likely to become addicted and long-term daily smokers. The report is supported by 11 organizations that advocate for tobacco-free communities and health equity for Black communities nationwide.

Alastair James Hay Murray, or Pub Landlord Al Murray as he is known to thousands of comedy fans, gave his backing to Crawley Borough Council’s Stoptober campaign as he visited the town on his latest tour.  The national campaign encourages smokers to quit smoking for 28 days and last year more than 2,000 West Sussex residents attempted to quit.  Mr Murray was on stage at The Hawth in Crawley for his One Man One Guvnor tour on the first day of Stoptober and posed for photos with Councillor Chris Oxlade, the borough council’s cabinet member for community engagement and wellbeing officer Matt Laird.  This year, the Stop Smoking Service is offering free support for those giving up and can be contacted on 0300 1001823 or visit www.smokefreewestsussex.co.uk.	google

(KELO) — One month ago, South Dakota implemented a ban on using electronic smoking devices in public places and workplaces. As regulations on vaping products continue across the country, a recent study in the journal of Substance Abuse & Misuse raises concerns that people may smoke more tobacco and vape less. As certain vaping flavors are taken off the shelves and bans are put in place experts say e-cig options are becoming limited. Sandra Williams-Luther, owner of Blown Away Vape in Sioux Falls says the tobacco industry is playing a big role in shining a negative light on vaping. “I’ve been watching the trend a lot. Even San Francisco has banned all e-cigarette devices even and I think it’s a way, they’re going backwards,” Sandra Williams-Luther said. “There was just one of these articles that I received that said patients that use an e-cigarette daily are 77 percent more likely to quit smoking than patients that don’t use an e-cigarette. However, they’re switching from one nicotine delivery device to another,” Dr. Anthony Hericks said. Dr. Hericks with Avera Health says inhaling nicotine in a tobacco cigarette or e-cig can cause health issues, and because e-cigs aren’t regulated it’s hard to determine exactly what types of health issues to expect without more research. But even with that in mind, Hericks says making the switch from tobacco cigarettes to e-cigs is beneficial. “I think using an e-cigarette as a way to quit smoking is very, very good thing to do. I think the problem is you have to have a plan,” Hericks said. Just like using a nicotine patch or gum, Hericks says there must be a plan to wean yourself off of the nicotine completely. But as e-cig regulations grow Williams-Luther has concerns that quitting tobacco with the help of e-cigs could become difficult. “The tobacco industry has killed thousands of thousands of people and yet they can walk into a store, buy cigarettes for 6 bucks a pack and now they want to ban something that helps people,” Williams-Luther said. Sandra says about half of her customers are former smokers who’ve quit, and since then turned to vaping. “It is a great way to quit smoking and the people that do come back, some of them quit altogether. They quit e-cigarettes altogether, they don’t need it anymore. Some of them use it occasionally, when they feel that urge because like I said it is a really hard habit to leave behind you,” Williams-Luther said. While Hericks says e-cigs could be helpful in quitting tobacco, he says all non-smokers, young adults, and women trying to become pregnant should avoid all e-cig products. Williams-Luther says Blown Away Vape is against underage use of e-cigarette products and does not allow anyone under the age of 18 to purchase any products from her store. To take a look at South Dakota’s current e-cigarette regulations, click here. Statement from Rob Cool, Owner of Yocan USA in Sioux Falls: To begin I think it is helpful to explain who we are. We started as an online vape retailer back in 2013. We quickly moved into nationwide distribution and wholesale of vape and smoke shop products. In the last year we have opened up to local retail because people kept calling asking if they could visit our shop (which was actually a warehouse). I mention this because I think it makes us pretty uniquely positioned to speak on the issues you are looking at. While South Dakota has not implemented a flavor ban or vaping tax we serve vape shops in states where those things have occurred. Our average customer is over 30 and looking to quit smoking. 96% of our customers choose a flavor other than tobacco or mint/menthol to help them quit smoking. The vast majority of our customers who use an e-cig to quit smoking use a ‘flavored’ vape product. In states with significant vaping taxes, like Vermont (92% vaping tax), what we have seen is a significant slowdown in vaping adoption. Vaping is normally about 80% cheaper than smoking. Adding significant taxes reduces or negates the cost advantage. While they may not push people back to smoking, vaping taxes do significantly slow down the adoption rate at which people move from smoking to vaping. Flavor bans on the other hand are another matter. In markets with flavor bans we have seen fairly catastrophic results. Vape sales drop significantly and shops close. It is difficult to get hard data but anecdotal feedback from our wholesale customers indicates many of their customers gave up on vaping when they did not have access to flavors they found attractive. People stop attempting to make the switch, and those that have made the switch already often move to out of state online suppliers in order to continue to receive the flavors they enjoy. The FDA has proposed (March 13, 2019 statement from Scott Gottlieb) that flavored e-cig products be sold only in adult-only settings, like vape shops, and we fully support that. We strongly believe this is an effective method to combat any temptation flavored products might present to kids while still allowing adult smokers reasonable access to the single most successful smoking cessation device in history. While vaping research in the US is often partisan and paid for by groups with specific agendas the UK’s NHS has done a significant amount of independent vaping research. Their studies indicate that while people trying nicotine gum have less than a 9% success rate in stopping smoking, e-cig users enjoy an almost 80% success rate. The UK’s NHS also estimates e-cigs are 95% safer than smoking. Taxes on cigarettes are meant to offset increased healthcare costs and discourage harmful behavior. Applying the same taxes to products that successfully reduce that harm seems counterproductive. Most news stories seem to talk about e-cigs not being 100% safe. We agree. Vaping is about harm reduction, not the total elimination of harm. If someone can simply quit smoking we encourage it. If someone doesn’t smoke we don’t encourage them to start vaping as a fun hobby. For those who can’t stop smoking on their own, e-cigs provide a realistic path to a less harmful lifestyle. Flavors are an important element in helping many adults stop smoking and reduce the harm presented by carcinogens present in cigarette smoke. Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.

13	f399441a-0f7a-3169-9ef0-8166530b5739	Utah Senate votes against proposal to raise age to purchase tobacco from 19 to 21	SALT LAKE CITY — Utah legislators have killed a proposal that could have made their state the first to raise the age for legal tobacco purchases to 21.  The bill's sponsor, Republican state Sen. Stuart Reid, had urged support for the measure so Utah could "set the example and make a statement to the nation."  Similar measures have been introduced in Colorado, New Jersey, Massachusetts and Hawaii this year. None of the measures have come close to becoming law, and it is unclear how many have momentum. Maryland lawmakers rejected a version of the plan last month.  The state-level proposals follow a precedent-setting New York City regulation that put the legal age for tobacco purchases at 21.  Several senators said they're concerned about the negative effects of smoking, but couldn't support the measure.  "When do you become an adult?" asked Sen. Todd Weiler, a Woods Cross Republican, on Tuesday. "If you raise it to 21, why not 23? Why not 25? Why not 50?"  The Utah Senate voted 12-16 against the bill Monday, arguing that the proposal infringes on the rights of legal adults to purchase a legal product.  Reid, of Ogden, had said the proposal would bring the smoking age in line with the legal age to purchase and drink alcohol.  He said that smoking had no value and that "when we identify something of no inherent value, we put limitations on it."  Reid also said his bill could prevent young people from becoming addicted to tobacco because it delays their access to it.  Opponents of his bill argued there's no evidence to support that.  Utah already is among a four states that ban sales for those younger than 19, instead of 18.  In November, New York City became the first large city to ban tobacco sales to people younger than 21.  Utah has the nation's lowest smoking rate, about 12 percent in 2011, the most recent year statistics are available, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Of the roughly 200,000 smokers in Utah, almost 90 percent started before age 18, according to the most recent report from Utah Department of Health's Tobacco Prevention and Control Program.  Reid's bill would have been effective in 2016, which he said gives the 18-, 19- and 20-year-olds who already smoke enough time to reach the new minimum age.	bing	New York City became the first large city to ban tobacco sales to people younger than 21		Of the roughly 200,000 smokers in Utah, almost 90 percent started before age 18, according to the most recent report from Utah Department of Health's Tobacco Prevention and Control Program.

14	5518be37-a3b1-35af-b3da-8e374a4a2ca4	FDA Action on Flavored E-Cigarettes - More Action Needed!	FDA Action on Flavored E-Cigarettes - More Action Needed! On September 9, the FDA announced that it had denied marketing applications for most flavored e-cigarettes, recognizing the role of flavored e-cigarettes in attracting youth. However, the FDA will leave our kids at risk unless it acts quickly on the remaining applications, including for products like Juul that have driven the youth e-cigarette epidemic, and eliminates all flavored e-cigarettes, including menthol-flavored products that are widely used by kids. Every day these products remain on the market, our kids remain in jeopardy. To truly protect kids and end the youth e-cigarette epidemic, the FDA must act swiftly to clear the market of all flavored e-cigarettes, including menthol. Why is it so critical for the FDA to act quickly on the remaining e-cigarette application? There is no public health justification for the FDA to allow the continued sale of any flavored e-cigarettes, including menthol-flavored products. There is overwhelming evidence that flavored e-cigarettes – including menthol products – appeal to kids and have fueled the youth e-cigarette epidemic, while there is a lack of evidence that flavored e-cigarettes are effective at helping smokers quit. Of the 3.6 million U.S. kids who use e-cigarettes, 83% report using flavored products and over 1 million use menthol e-cigarettes, according to the 2020 National Youth Tobacco Survey. The evidence shows that kids quickly migrated to menthol e-cigarettes after mint and other flavored cartridge products were taken off the market. If the FDA authorizes any menthol e-cigarettes, even more kids are likely to use them. There is only limited and inadequate evidence to conclude that e-cigarettes are effective at helping smokers quit.The 2020 Surgeon General’s Report on Smoking Cessation concluded, “there is presently inadequate evidence to conclude that e-cigarettes, in general, increase smoking cessation.” The World Health Organization reached a similar conclusion in a July 2021 report, finding that “evidence on the use of ENDS [electronic nicotine delivery systems] as a cessation aid is inconclusive.” The evidence is even weaker that flavored e-cigarettes, including menthol-flavored products, are effective at helping smokers quit. The Juul products pending before the FDA put kids doubly at risk. Not only do they come in menthol flavor attractive to kids, these products also have high nicotine levels – equivalent to a whole pack of cigarettes – that can rapidly addict kids. The FDA cannot allow these highly addictive, menthol-flavored Juul products to stay on the market. But Juul’s menthol e-cigarettes are not the only issue. Other menthol cigarettes such as blu and Reynolds American’s Vuse are also important. Because of the delays and gaps in the FDA’s actions, it is critical that states and cities step up their efforts to eliminate ALL flavored e-cigarettes, as well as other flavored tobacco products.

Not many people can say they do.  As stated on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website, in 2011, an estimated 43.8 million adults in the United States were current smokers. Although men tend to smoke more than women, cigarette smoking claims more than 440,000 Ameri­can lives each year.  In addition, smoking costs the United States an average of $193 billion, including $96 billion in direct health care expenditures and $97 billion in lost pro­ductivity. This means that smoking costs an average of $4,260 per adult smoker, per year. Imagine what a per­son could do with that much money, if they weren’t spending it on smoking.  According to the American Lung As­sociation, “cigarette smoke contains over 4,800 chemicals, 69 of which are known to cause cancer.”  Not only do cigarettes contain chemicals such as nicotine, which make them highly addictive, but tobacco by itself can have a serious effect on a regular smoker.  As confirmed on the World Health Orga­nization website, “tobacco use is one of the main risk factors for a number of chronic diseases, including cancer, lung diseases, and cardiovascular diseases.”  Despite these findings however, tobacco still remains very common throughout the world. Although a number of countries have legislation restricting tobacco advertising, regulating who can purchase cigarettes, where people are allowed to smoke, and increasing the cost of cigarettes, people are still giving in to the costly habit.  It is important to understand that even though smoking is directly responsible for approximately 90 percent of lung cancer deaths and approximately 80-90 percent of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), secondhand smoking can be just as damaging to a person’s health.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website, approxi­mately 46,000 nonsmokers in the United States die from heart disease each year, along with an estimated 3,400 annual lung cancer deaths among adult nonsmokers. Not only this, but nonsmokers who are exposed to secondhand smoke at home or work in­crease their lung cancer risk by 20-30 per­cent.  Although some of these numbers can come off as being pretty intimidating, it is reassuring to know that there are a number of resources available to smokers that can help them kick the habit. These resources are very beneficial b e c a u s e not only do smokers become physically addicted to nicotine, but they also link smoking with many social ac­tivities, thus making smoking an even more difficult addiction to break.  As stated on the American Lung Asso­ciation website, there are seven medications approved by the US Food and Drug Admin­istration to aid in quitting smoking. These include over-the-counter nicotine patches, nicotine gum, and nicotine lozenges, nico­tine nasal spray and inhaler (which are available by prescription), and Zyban and Chantix (which are non-nicotine pills).  Not only are there medications avail­able to help people quit smoking, but there are numerous different types of counseling to help current smokers as well. This in­cludes individual, group, or telephone – all of which have been proven to be effective. Often times, the combination of using a medication and counseling is even more ef­fective than just doing one or the other.  Quitting smoking often requires mul­tiple attempts, so it is important to stick to it. If you truly want to live a healthier life­style, perseverance is key. For many people it doesn’t happen overnight, so keep going!	bing

18	39786e9c-28c8-30c1-94f9-723bcc70071e	California declares electronic cigarettes a health threat	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California health officials Wednesday declared electronic cigarettes a health threat that should be strictly regulated like tobacco products, joining other states and health advocates across the U.S. in seeking tighter controls as "vaping" grows in popularity.  The California Department of Public Health released a report saying e-cigarettes emit cancer-causing chemicals and get users hooked on nicotine but acknowledging that more research needs to be done to determine the immediate and long-term health effects.  "E-cigarettes are not as harmful as conventional cigarettes, but e-cigarettes are not harmless" said California Health Officer Ron Chapman. "They are not safe."  New generations of young people will become nicotine addicts if the products remain largely unregulated, Chapman said. Last year, 17 percent of high school seniors reported using e-cigarettes, known as vaping, according to the report.  "Without action, it is likely that California's more than two decades of progress to prevent and reduce traditional tobacco use will erode as e-cigarettes re-normalize smoking behavior," the report says.  E-cigarettes heat liquid nicotine into inhalable vapor without the tar and other chemicals found in traditional cigarettes. A cartridge of nicotine can cost anywhere from $5 to $20 dollars and can be reused.  California banned the sale of e-cigarettes to minors in 2010, but the report raises concerns about children consuming liquid nicotine with flavors such as cotton candy and gummy bear. Reports of children under 5 with e-cigarette poisoning jumped from seven in 2012 to 154 last year.  The California report says e-cigarettes emit as many as 10 toxic chemicals, but advocates say there is no evidence those substances are released at dangerous levels.  "Despite the health officer's false claims, there is ample evidence that vaping helps smokers quit and is far less hazardous than smoking," Gregory Conley, president of the e-cigarette advocacy group American Vaping Association, said in an email. "Smokers deserve truthful and accurate information about the relative risks of different nicotine products, not hype and conjecture based on cherry-picked reports."  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is also proposing regulations that include warning labels and ingredient lists on e-cigarettes, although enactment could take years. California health officials are calling for restrictions on the marketing and sale of e-cigarettes and protections against accidental ingestion of liquid nicotine.  A state senator introduced legislation this week that would regulate e-cigarettes as tobacco products and ban their use in public places such as hospitals, bars and schools. A similar bill was defeated last year over opposition from tobacco companies.  Chapman, the health official, would not take a position on specific legislation, but said his department would be rolling out an e-cigarette awareness campaign with possible television and radio advertisements.  E-cigarettes have become more visible as they grow in popularity and commercials for the products air in places where traditional cigarette ads have been banned. Businesses related to e-cigarettes, including vaping lounges, are rapidly popping up in cities across California.  Geoff Braithwaite, co-owner of an Oakland store that sells liquid nicotine for e-cigarettes, said he understands the need to restrict vaping in public and prevent sales to minors. He says his customers are longtime smokers who should be able to get a nicotine buzz without the harshness of a regular cigarette.  "Nicotine has all this stigma attached solely to the medium we used to use," Braithwaite said. "When you try to outright ban e-cigarettes, you're lumping in the solution with the problem."  Other states, including Oklahoma, Tennessee and Arkansas, already have issued advisories cautioning the use of e-cigarettes. Legislatures have been exploring restrictions on e-cigarette marketing, adding childproof packaging requirements and imposing taxes to discourage use.  "Health officials want to be proactive on this important public health issue," said Lisa Waddell, who leads community health and prevention at the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. "The issue of real concern here is we really don't know everything that's in these products, and you are seeing the rise of the use of these products in our children as well as our adults."	bing	California health officials Wednesday declared electronic cigarettes a health threat that should be strictly regulated like tobacco products, joining other states and health advocates across the U.S. in seeking tighter controls as "vaping" grows in popularity.

Food and Drug Administration Listen Listening... / Originally published on May 2, 2018 6:25 am The Food and Drug Administration and Federal Trade Commission on Tuesday sent warning letters to 13 manufacturers, distributors and retailers of e-cigarette liquids. In a phone briefing for reporters, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said the companies are endangering kids by marketing the products to resemble juice boxes, cookies or candy. "You look at the lollipop for example. I don't see how my 4- or 5-year-old doesn't just look at that and see a lollipop. It's a lollipop," he said. E-liquids are used in electronic cigarettes, and they often use nicotine which can cause illness — even death — if ingested by a small child. Products targeted have names like Smurf Sauce and V'Nilla Cookies & Milk. "These are being deliberately designed in ways that they can be just mistakenly confused by a child," Gottlieb said in the briefing. The agencies cited recent national data of thousands of nicotine exposures in kids younger than 6, who accidentally ingested the vaping liquid. The letters and violations vary somewhat by company but, overall, the letters say the products' appeal to minors violates parts of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, which gives the FDA authority over marketing and distributing tobacco products. "Today's announcement should send a clear signal that companies selling these products have a responsibility to insure they aren't putting children in harm's way or enticing youth use," Gottlieb said. He warned more actions would be coming. Jameson Rodgers is vice president of business development for California-based NEwhere Inc., one of the companies that received a letter. He says his company's products are only for adults who want to switch to vaping from traditional cigarettes, which he says are less healthful. The FDA targeted the company's One Mad Hit Juice Box e-liquid. Rodgers says the company voluntarily removed it from distribution last year. "We definitely didn't intend to position it as a product that would appeal to anybody who wasn't of legal smoking age," he says, though he admits it might have sent a "questionable" message. "Really would you buy a product, a vape with the name Dancing Monkey or Cotton Candy? At the end of the day we're trying to create products that have the ability to compete against Big Tobacco," he says. According to its website, TVECA is a nonprofit dedicated to "create a sensible and responsible electronic cigarette market" by providing education, communication and research to media, lawmakers and consumers. Tuesday's warning letters are part of a larger push by the federal government to crack down on youth access to tobacco products, including vaping. Last week the FDA sent a warning letter to 40 retail stores for selling the e-cigarette brand Juul to minors. They also asked the company for research on its appeal to children and teenagers. Health officials say Juul is highly addictive, and it's so new there's scant research about its health effects. The companies targeted Tuesday have 15 days to respond — to either defend their practices or explain how they'll change their labeling, or risk federal action such as fines or prosecution. This story is part of a reporting partnership with NPR, Colorado Public Radio and Kaiser Health News.	webhose.io			Two U.S. government agencies are warning companies that sell vaping products that their packaging resembles candy and may be in violation of safety and marketing guidelines because of its possible appeal to teens and children							
21	f77a1229-3faf-3484-881d-ea8d97a70420	Experts are pushing for a tobacco-free world by approximately 2040	Leading experts have called for a "turbocharged" global campaign that could lead to a tobacco-free world by 2040.  They warn that despite the decline of smoking in the developed world, tobacco use is expected to increase in some countries over the next decade, notably in Africa and the Middle East.  With global population rising, there could still be more than a billion people smoking in 2025 unless urgent action is taken, it is claimed.  The call to arms in the fight against smoking comes in a series of articles published in the Lancet medical journal and will be launched at the World Conference on Tobacco and Health being held in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.  Professor Robert Beaglehole, from the University of Auckland, New Zealand, who co-led the international group of public health and policy experts, said: "The time has come for the world to acknowledge the unacceptability of the damage being done by the tobacco industry and work towards a world essentially free from the legal and illegal sale of tobacco products.  "A world where tobacco is out of sight, out of mind, and out of fashion - yet not prohibited - is achievable in less than three decades from now, but only with full commitment from governments, international agencies, such as UN and WHO (World Health Organisation), and civil society."  Global tobacco regulation should be "turbocharged", with the United Nations taking a leading role in efforts to eliminate the sale and use of tobacco.  The experts pointed out that falling demand for tobacco in rich parts of the world had caused the "big four" tobacco companies to turn their attention to low and middle-income countries.  Their alleged tactics included industrial litigation, lobbying through third-party groups, and covert maintenance of political pressure disguised as "corporate social responsibility".  Professor Anna Gilmore, another of the authors from the University of Bath, said: "Contrary to industry claims, tobacco marketing deliberately targets women and young people.  "The tobacco industry continues to interfere with governments' efforts to implement effective tobacco control policies. If the world is to become tobacco free, it's vital that the industry's appalling conduct receives far closer scrutiny and countries which stand up to the industry's bullying tactics receive better global support."  Deborah Arnott, chief executive of the charity Action on Smoking and Health (Ash) said: "Along with many other rich nations, we have made good progress in reducing tobacco use over the past several decades.  "However, one in five UK adults continue to smoke, not through choice but because they are addicted.  "And 100,000 die early each year as a result.  "The authors of the Lancet articles are right that we need to do more to tackle the tobacco industry and to make it pay for the damage it does.  "This is just what the tobacco levy currently being consulted on by HM Treasury could achieve.  "But it is essential that the money raised should be used to encourage smokers to quit and to discourage young people from taking up this deadly habit."	bing					They warn that despite the decline of smoking in the developed world, tobacco use is expected to increase in some countries over the next decade, notably in Africa and the Middle East					
22	1571625a-46c4-3241-afbd-63ad73952230	India Says E-cigarette Ban Implies Use Of Devices Also Prohibited	The Indian government has told a court that its federal ban on the sale of electronic cigarettes implies that their use is also prohibited, legal documents seen by Reuters showed, in a further clampdown on the devices. Citing health risks, India in September banned the import, manufacture, sale, advertisement, storage and distribution of e-cigarettes, dashing future plans of companies such as U.S.-based Juul Labs and Philip Morris International. India's decision, however, did not ban the use of such devices outright, and a senior Health Ministry official told Reuters after the announcement that e-cigarette use would not be barred. However, in a Nov. 5 filing in a Kolkata court, where the government is defending two legal challenges against the ban, the ministry said it was "completely baseless" to say only the sale and manufacture of e-cigarettes and vaping devices were barred, and not use. "The ordinance is aimed at banning the product. Once the import, production, manufacture, distribution and storage of e-cigarettes is prohibited, it is implied that the use of e-cigarettes is also prohibited," said the court filing, which has been reviewed by Reuters and has not been made public. The Health Ministry official said on Monday the court document was "factually correct", without giving further details due to the court proceedings. The official added the authorities would not take action against the "personal use" of e-cigarettes. The filing, however, has unnerved users, who argue against the ban and say they fear police action if they continue using the devices. "This filing goes against the Health Ministry's announcements that personal use is not banned," said Samrat Chowdhery of Association of Vapers India. He added India should add a clause to its ban order to exclude personal use. India banned the sale of e-cigarettes as it fears they could lead to increased nicotine addiction. Advocates for e-cigarettes say vaping is far less harmful than smoking tobacco. India's 106 million adult smokers, second only to China, make it an attractive market for companies such as Juul, which had plans to launch its device in the country. "As Juul, an e-cigarette giant was entering India and would flood the Indian markets ... (the ban order) became all the more imminent and necessary," the Health Ministry said in one of its court filings.	rss	The Indian government has told a court that its federal ban on the sale of electronic cigarettes implies that their use is also prohibited

The team at Smiles First Dental can certainly get behind an event that promotes health! Which is why we’re covering a couple of reasons why quitting smoking, even if you’ve tried before, may be a worthwhile goal. #1. Smokers are 50% more likely to develop gum disease than non-smokers Advanced research has shown smoking has been linked to an increased risk of infection, including gum disease. Gum diseases are often a painful problem which will eventually cause tooth loss. #2. Smoking inhibits your body’s ability to heal Whenever your body undergoes trauma, whether that’s a serious surgery or minor cut, it relies on a robust flow of healthy blood to heal. Smoking, however, restricts blood vessels and diminishes the quantity of blood that moves throughout the system. #3. Tobacco users are 6 times more likely to develop oral cancer While oral cancer can occur in anyone, people that use tobacco are at a way greater risk. Oral cancer can affect the tongue, throat, cheeks, or the other area of the mouth. If caught early oral cancer are often successfully treated. #4. Yellow teeth and bad breath are incredibly common Tobacco products contain tar and nicotine. Both of these ingredients can stick to teeth, gums, and the tongue and are difficult to remove. Because of this, smokers and users of other forms of tobacco usually have discoloured teeth and unpleasant breath. If you are looking for a quick and effective way of getting whiter teeth, a teeth whitening procedure can be done at our dental clinic in Northmead. #5. Tooth loss is 2 times more prevalent in smokers Due to several of other reasons above, like a drier mouth and a decreased ability to heal, smokers are more likely to suffer more tooth loss than non-smokers. Oftentimes, smokers may lose their teeth before their non-using counterparts. This is especially important right now as studies show that smokers have a higher risk of acquiring a severe case of coronavirus. Join us in the fight to become a tobacco-free generation.

City leaders decided on Tuesday to keep it this way by adopting an ordinance that prohibits such businesses from opening in the city. The new prohibition, which was nearly a year in the making, was prompted when an entrepreneur approached City Hall early in 2015 about starting a tobacco-related business. The request caught city officials off-guard after realizing the zoning code lacked any language or sections that prevented these businesses in American Canyon. The City Council tackled the problem by first adopting an emergency ordinance that kept the would-be tobacco shop from moving forward, giving council members time to unanimously adopt a permanent ban Tuesday evening. It is the first of its kind in Napa County. “As a city we’ve already taken action to make our parks tobacco-free” and to maintain “a clean healthy environment” in American Canyon, said Councilmember Belia Ramos in supporting the ordinance. Vice Mayor Joan Bennett agreed, saying the development of stores that focus on selling cigarettes was a bad fit for the “family-oriented community.” “There are so many young people who get involved in cigarette use,” said Bennett, who was in favor of discouraging smoking among teenagers or to at least make it harder for them to start. “I’m happy to make them go a few miles down the road” to Vallejo if they really want to smoke or vape, she said. Get breaking news sent instantly to your inbox Sign Up! I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site consitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy. Bennett was referring to a staff report indicating Vallejo has nearly 20 businesses that cater to tobacco products or the growing e-cigarette and hookah lounge trade. The same report, prepared by Community Development Director Brent Cooper, cited the U.S. Surgeon General while stating “tobacco use is a pediatric epidemic in the United States because 99 percent of all first tobacco use occurs by age 26.” It further justified the adoption of the new ordinance by noting the practice of tobacco companies to “capitalize on the vulnerability of our youth, minorities, lower income residents, and young adults to promote their products.” The ban will not apply to retailers like Safeway or Wal-Mart that sell tobacco or smokeless products as part of a much larger product mix. Tuesday’s decision was the first of two votes on the ordinance. The council intends to bring the matter back at its next meeting and vote on it again, presumably with the same unanimous outcome.

25	5dec26a2-1755-3eb9-bb6f-1d6ed3a2b2a8	Blog: World No Tobacco Day: Here's why vaping is as harmful as smoking cigarettes	Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) is a collective term used to house the new electronically driven vapes, most commonly available over-the-counter, online, and sheepishly marketed E-Cigarettes. How often have you been told that e-cigarettes are a healthy alternative to conventional cigarettes? How often have they caused you an urge to take up a stick which is as easily available as the smartphone you own? Haven’t you heard of misinformed healthcare practitioners also falsely claiming that e-cigarettes are an easy alternative to cigarette smoking? What are e-cigarettes? They are electronic devices that replicate cigarettes, cigar and smoking pipes. They mimic the original in looks, tastes and feel; and expel colourless aerosols that look like smoke but are not. The hype behind its popularity got “vaping” -- or the process of smoking e-cigarettes -- the honour of being chosen as the International Word of the year 2014 by Oxford Dictionary. US agencies report about 900 per cent growth in the use of e-cigarettes in recent years. Also, vaping competitions have given teens a major thrust and chance to be perceived as being “cool” in society. Ironically, these websites allow teens to register themselves by the age of 13 years even though these e-cigarettes cannot be sold to anyone below the age of 18 years. The exponential rise in the use of e-cigarettes can be attributed to its sleek design. The electronic equipment can be recharged, is customisable and is available in a plethora of flavours and additives. Without an iota of doubt, this device is a perfect fit for teens who are impulsive and have a drive to try new things. This stick provides them with a perfect blend of technology which can be customised and innovative. E-cigarettes can contain nicotine or can be nicotine free. Both these have their share of severe, potent and long-lasting negative effects. Introduced as an alternative to cigarettes and to combat cigarette addiction, these devices were meant to offer nicotine-free smoke but as mentioned it can be customised with any additives, be it nicotine, alcohol or any synthetic flavours with the concentration they want. Technically speaking, they are nothing but a fancy assembly of a cartridge, a heating coil/ chip, lithium ion battery and volatile liquid. The battery can be plugged in any USB port for charging. All this can be tactfully done to make it look just like a cigarette, yet promoting it as an easy alternative to quit the cigarette smoking addiction. Contrary to popular belief, the smoke produced is not water vapour; those are aerosols which are suspended in air for long hours. The additives added to the liquid in form of flavours and colours can have heavy metal ions which are known to cause irreversible organ damage. Apart from physiological effects, the psychological dependence seen with these products is highly pronounced as they are not depicted as a threat as compared to contemporary cigarettes even when they are known to contain nicotine. Nicotine, apart from causing psychological dependence, is known to bind with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors throughout the body. Chronic exposure may lead to loss of elasticity of blood vessels, narrowing of air spaces in lungs, loss of flexibility of heart muscles and so on. Animal studies already have shown nicotine to be brain damaging and causing irreversible damage in areas of comprehension i.e learning and memory, producing hyper-reactivate humans. Mentioning some technicalities- the e-cigarettes have nicotine, propylene glycol and glycerine. The FDA has issued blaring warning signs regarding the harmful effects of the TSNAs (Tobacco Specific Nitrosamines) and DEGs (Di-Ethylene Glycols) it emits. Also, it is a very well-established fact that teens exposed to nicotine or any form of physical or psychological addiction are more prone to end up doing drugs and alcohol. Synergetic effect of these things are not only seen with their own generation but may also lead to gene defect which can be seen in their offsprings. Following suit, on recommendations from the top portals of the Govt. of India, the Ministry of Health and family Welfare, Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS), Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO), 12 states in India, including Maharashtra, have banned these ‘new emerging threats’- ending the ENDS. India being the second most populous country in the world is home to a significant ‘demogarphic dividend’ of population younger than 25 years old. It is fundamental duty of every individual to dethrone what doesn’t serve the purpose and enlighten every individual of its effects. Collectively we aren’t only looking at the dangers of tobacco related products but also the newer versions which are catching the attention of a lot of today's youth. A difficulty well foreseen and worked upon will help to reduce the number of youths falling into the trap of societal and peer pressures to look and be “cool”.

26	c3afa078-ca96-3c57-afc3-3a6b9269b00b	Illegal sale of imported cigarettes on rise in Punjab  Indian News in Tampa Bay Area	Punjab,National,Crime/Disaster/Accident Chandigarh, Sep 19 (IANS) Illegal sale of imported cigarettes in Punjab has become common and pose a serious threat to health of smokers who are getting hooked to catchy packs of international brands that san health warnings, anti-tobacco activists said on Thursday. They say selling illegal cigarettes, an organised crime, is not only evading state's high taxes but also playing with the lives of smokers, mainly the first-timers, because of inferior manufacturing processes and low quality tobacco with high levels of tar and nicotine. Trade insiders told IANS that Punjab alone has an annual legal market of 120 million cigarettes and the illegal market accounts for 20 per cent of the total trade. Chandigarh and Panchkula cities have a market of 30 million and six million cigarettes annually and the illegal market also has a share of 15-20 per cent. Most of the illegal cigarette brands originate from China and Indonesia and the retailers are attracting to them as they are available at a significantly lower price than the legal cigarettes. They are sold in the market at one fifth the price of legal product. "The trade of illegal brands is getting acute in big cities like Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Patiala and Amritsar where the retailers prefer to sell these brands that are cheap in the market and the profit margin is enormous," said an insider. He said there is a huge price difference between Indian brand of cigarettes and the illegal one due to evasion of tax. Take the case of an imported brand. A pack of 20 cigarettes costs Rs 20-30 to a retailer, who is selling at a cost of Rs 100. While an Indian brand cost between Rs 250 and Rs 300 with a profit margin of approximately Rs 5. "We have submitted a list of outlets selling illegal cigarettes across Punjab but local authorities are not taking action. In fact, the shops or kiosks outside the Deputy Commissioner's offices in Ludhiana and Jalandhar are indulging in this clandestine trade," a member of the Tobacco Institute of India (TII) here told IANS. The TII is a representative body of farmers, manufacturers and exporters in the country. These imported brands not adhere to Indian law and regulations. It has submitted its representation to the Punjab Director General of Police many a time, seeking action against retailers selling illegal tobacco products. At a media workshop here this month, experts warned of an impending crisis with implications for health and government revenues in wake of unfettered growth in manufacture and sales of illicit cigarettes in Punjab and Haryana. R.K. Tiwari of the Centre for Public Awareness said due to low surveillance and lack of regulations, manufacturers are using Punjab and Haryana as dumping ground of illicit cigarettes. Punjab Government spokesperson said the state has initiated a state-wide crusade to curb use of tobacco and habit-making products to save the youth under 'Mission Tandarust Punjab'. He said the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act (COTPA) of 2003 has been strictly implemented. It is being monitored at state level by Additional Chief Secretary Health and Family Welfare and at district by the Deputy Commissioners. A bill was passed by the legislative assembly in March last year to permanently ban hookah and hookah bars in the state. tampabayIndian.com is operated under IndianLoop.com network (Broadlink, LLC site) and is a Trademark of BroadLink, LLC.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is in the process of drafting new regulations to remove flavored e-cigarettes from the market, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told journalists at the White House on Wednesday, Efe news reported. Once the rules are published, the industry and vendors will have 30 days to comply, the secretary said during a meeting in the Oval Office with President Donald Trump and the acting commissioner of the FDA, Ned Sharpless. "We can't allow people to get sick and we can't have our youth be so affected," Trump said. "People are dying from vaping, so we're looking at it very closely." First lady Melania Trump spoke out about the dangers of vaping earlier this week. "That's how the first lady got involved. She's got a son, together, that is a beautiful young man and she feels very, very strongly about it," the president said, referring to the Trumps' 13-year-old son, Barron. "She's seen it. We're both reading it, a lot of people are reading it. But people are dying with vaping so we're looking at it very, very closely," the president said. The FDA has yet to regulate e-cigarettes and has regarded the tobacco-flavoured versions as useful in helping adult smokers move away from conventional cigarettes. The move announced by Azar will entail a provisional ban on all sales of flavoured e-cigarettes, though the devices could return to the market if they secure FDA approval. "Kids are getting access to these products despite our best efforts at enforcement," Azar said. "They've been going at it so we simply have to remove these attractive flavoured products from the marketplace until they've secured FDA approval if they can." At least six deaths are blamed on respiratory illnesses related to vaping and health authorities have documented a total of 450 cases involving e-cigarettes, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which has issued a health warning against vaping. Last week, Michigan became the first state to issue an order aimed at ending the sale of all non-tobacco-flavoured e-cigarettes within its borders. Citing a CDC survey of teenagers, the Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement that more than 25 per cent of high school students used e-cigarettes within the last month. The "overwhelming majority" of those users said that they vaped fruit and menthol or mint flavours. Azar said Wednesday that his department will be alert to any increase in use of tobacco flavoured e-cigarettes by minors. "If we find that children start surging into tobacco flavoured e-cigarettes or if we find marketing practices that target children and try to attract them into tobacco flavoured e-cigarettes, we will engage in enforcement actions there also," the secretary said.

28	5445a7e6-cc29-38cc-a4f2-7613ba831bda	E-cigarettes: Help flick the switch	Like Brexit and Trump, electronic cigarettes (e-cigs) and other vaping devices take their place among some of the most hotly debated subjects of 2016.     In fact, the growing category - which is now thought to be worth £450m in the UK, according to Blu, and used by an estimated 2.8 million people (predominantly former and current smokers) - has rarely been out of the news this year, as health experts, legislators and retailers dispute vaping’s pros, cons and future developments.    The category hit the headlines a number of times in September alone, with the British Heart Foundation questioning the impact of nicotine-containing e-cigs on vapers’ heart health, followed just a few days later by a new report published in the British Medical Journal which claimed that increased e-cig usage was helping conventional smokers to quit more successfully.    Vaping products themselves are becoming increasingly visible as convenience stores, newsagents and other grocery retailers move away from cluttered and confusing counter-top units towards high-impact back wall and standalone shop floor displays.     And with tobacco products now hidden from view and new European Tobacco Product Directive (EUTPD) laws already fuelling a dramatic reduction in the number of tobacco SKUs, the prominence of e-cigs in convenience stores looks set to increase in the months ahead.     Companies such as Real Trading, which provides convenience stores with bespoke, lit displays containing room for several leading brands and associated hardware, are enjoying booming business, while JTI is currently rolling out a new gantry solution that puts e-cigs, and its Logic Pro tank system, firmly in the spotlight.     Arjan Mehr of Londis Great Hollands in Bracknell, Berkshire, is just one retailer already tasting success with the new JTI unit, which allows tobacco products to be kept hidden behind doors on one side, while the other is left open to display e-cigs.    “This solution is a great way to merchandise e-cigs,” he says. “I think it’s important to site e-cigs and tobacco together on the back wall. JTI’s approach creates space which will allow me to showcase a wide range, which is critical in driving footfall.”    Dee Sedani of One Stop Matlock, Derbyshire, is another: “The new-look unit is working really well. I’m able to draw attention to the growing e-cig opportunity with a dedicated space, while also managing the category responsibly,” he says.    In Cobham, Surrey, another retailer who extols the virtues of a high-impact standalone vaping display is David Worlsfold of Farrants.     “Visibility is without a doubt one of the most important factors in driving sales of vaping products,” he says.    “We have a striking standalone unit, designed and built by premium vaping brand Liberty Flights, positioned on the shop floor, but immediately next to the counter and main tills. The large black unit allows products to really stand out and we stock a wide range of kits, cartomizers and liquids in all manner of flavours and nicotine strengths to give new and existing vapers a vast range of options.     “The fact that the unit is on the shop floor allows existing vapers and new converts to browse the full range unrestricted, yet counter staff are immediately on hand should they require advice.     “Our approach is clearly working as we sell upwards of £2,000-worth of vaping products a month, and that figure is growing.     “I’m a strong believer that if you decide to take on a new category you should own it and that’s what we are doing with vaping products.”    The vaping category also lends itself perfectly to impactful promotions.    Jennifer Roberts, UK category controller at Blu, says that multi-buy activities on liquids - such as ‘two for £8’, for example - are a great way to boost interest and sales. “Clearomisers are also a great way to drive additional sales and margin as consumers should change these units every few weeks,” she says.    “Ensure you stock the clearomisers for the tank brands you stock and remind your customers to buy them every time you sell a bottle of liquid,” she concludes.    Scott Rothwell, owner of Eaves Lane Londis, Chorley, Lancashire, is certainly reaping the rewards a well-managed and promoted e-cig range can bring, selling almost £1,000-worth of vaping products a week.     His vast range of e-liquids is a big draw for local vapers, and the bottles, which he buys in for between £3.24 and £4.25, sell for £10 each, or as part of a popular ‘three for £25’ deal.     However, keen to maintain momentum, Scott has been focusing heavily on promotion and ways of driving repeat purchase, developing a loyalty card scheme in the process.    Cardholders who buy into the store’s ‘three for £25’ e-liquid deal nine times get their 10th purchase for half-price at £12.50.    And as with any rapidly-developing category, but particularly one which is subject to so much new legislation and debate, education is key.    “Vaping is a journey and we strive to support our customers on it at every step,” David adds. “Tobacco smokers looking to switch to vaping are always a bit recalcitrant at first, it’s as though they almost want the experience to fail. That’s why it’s so important to really understand the category so you can recommend the correct products for their needs.     “It’s important that new vapers understand that it’s not a silver bullet to give up smoking, more of a bronze one, and there might be a little trial and error at first.     “That’s why choice is key. Vaping is an investment and new vapers don’t want to see just one car in the showroom, they want to see a range of options. Inevitably, though, once we’ve taken them through all their options, first-timers tend to buy the same sort of product: our entry-level kit which includes a tank, rechargeable battery and a liquid for £19. Taking the time to talk them through their options and getting them on the right sort of product that includes the right level of nicotine content is well worth it, as when it works, new vapers become almost evangelical about it and you benefit from strong loyalty,” he adds.     So how is the market developing? According to a new report produced by Ernst & Young (E&Y) for BAT-owned Nicoventures, 4% of the UK population now vapes and the number of UK vapers has almost doubled over the past two years, fuelled by “the perception of relative health benefits compared with combustible cigarettes”.    As most vapers are either current or ex-smokers, the lower price of e-cigs when compared with combustible tobacco products was found to be a factor, but not a driving one.    The UK market can be broadly divided into three key categories, according to the report. These are: disposable products - which can be discarded when the pre-filled cartridge of e-liquid is empty; rechargeable products - which are designed to be refilled by the user.; and modular products - which can also be refilled by the user, but also allow users to regulate the power delivered from the batteries to the atomizer.    Modular devices have overtaken rechargeable as the most commonly-used type of device by UK vapers. Modulars are now chosen by 59% of UK vapers compared with 39% of users who use rechargeable e-cigs. The least popular devices are disposables, which now account for just 16% of sales.     As the vaping category becomes better established, regulated and trusted, these pricier, more complex modular devices are growing increasingly popular with first-time vapers. In fact, according to E&Y, 27% of new UK vapers now start off using a modular device. Just over 30% use a disposable product, while most (41%) take their first puffs on a rechargeable product.     Liquid lines    Understandably, the booming sales of modular products are driving an associated increase in sales of e-liquids. Jennifer Roberts, UK category controller at Blu, elaborates: “We’re seeing more and more consumers entering the category going straight into the ‘open’ liquid systems (tank kits and e-liquids), with more than 40% of value share in the market coming from e-liquids and e-liquid systems.”     She adds: “E-liquid formats remain the fastest-growing area of e-cigs in the UK, growing at 102% year on year due to the value savings, greater flavour range and the increased product performance they offer (Nielsen scantrack 52 weeks to 13 August 2016).    “To offer consumers a real choice we recommend retailers stock a range of flavours and strengths to suit different needs.”    According to the latest JTI insight, the three most popular vaping flavours are menthol (37%), followed by fruit (30%), then tobacco (29%).    Nicotine    Just as with flavours, UK vapers can choose from a wide range of nicotine strengths, including 0% nicotine, which is growing in popularity.     In the UK, 65% of vapers’ most commonly-used devices contain between 1 and 11mg of nicotine, according to E&Y. Just under 20% of devices currently smoked contain 12 to 18mg of nicotine, while 13% are nicotine-free. Only 5% of consumption is accounted for by nicotine strengths of 18mg plus - good news considering the EUTPD will ban the production of e-liquids containing more than 20mg/ml in November.     It’s vital that retailers have a wide range, and firm understanding, of the different nicotine strengths that they offer, says e-cig brand Vaporized. Allowing a new vaper to buy the wrong one can lead to a negative experience and potentially hamper future sales.     With most vapers using e-cigs as a way to cut down or stop smoking tobacco, Vaporized suggests that retailers always ask new and existing vapers about their tobacco smoking habits. Questions such as how many cigarettes do they, or did they, smoke a day and which brand can help retailers work out the correct nicotine strength for them.    As a rough guide:     6mg/0.6% (low) - up to 10 cigarettes a day     12mg/1.2% (medium) - up to 20 cigarettes a day     18mg/1.8% (high) - up to 30 cigarettes a day    David Worlsfold recommends that existing smokers switching to vaping use a 1.8% nicotine strength e-liquid at first “so that they get a similar sort of nicotine hit to tobacco”.    “We then find that within a few months the level naturally reduces to 1.2% and we are now seeing growth of nicotine-free e-liquids,” he says.     Legal lowdown    EUTPD laws also apply to cigarettes and rolling tobacco. Liquid refill bottles cannot contain more than 10ml of liquid and products cannot contain more than 20mg/ml of nicotine. Packaging will need to contain health warnings and correct labelling, be tamper resistant and child proof, and products must also be registered with the Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency.     According to Blu, suppliers and manufacturers are “busy putting their plans in place for being compliant.”     “There are significant costs involved in this, so many brands are expected to drop out of the market,” Blu’s Roberts adds.     Danny Sohota, of specialist vaping distributor Real Trading, agrees. “There are more than 900 brands on the market, with this estimated to reduce by at least 50% when EUTPD kicks in,” he says.  Phase 1: Advertising and promotion restrictions came into effect, restricting TV, radio, consumer press and social media advertising Retailer action: Increase visibility and POS in-store to drive awareness and sales Retailer action: Understand what compliant products look like and start to promote existing stock to sell-through Phase 3: The sale of non-compliant stock is no longer allowed Retailer action: It is now retailers’ responsibility to stock and sell fully-compliant products. Blu recommends buying only compliant stock post-January 2017 to give retailers time to sell through old stock.  E-liquids: Mind your Ps and Vs E-liquids can contain a mix of two, or sometimes three, key ‘diluents’ alongside flavour and maybe nicotine. These diluents are known as PG, VG, and sometimes AG, and each boasts a particular set of attributes to suit different vaping needs. PG stands for propylene glycol. It’s a thin, clear, odourless liquid which has long been used as a preservative and flavour carrier in food products, and is well-liked for its ability to carry, and even enhance, e-liquid flavours and deliver a “strong throat hit”. VG stands for vegetable glycerine. The thick and naturally sweet liquid is made from vegetable oil and is also commonly used in food products, cosmetics and toothpaste as a sweetener. VG-based e-liquids deliver a smooth vaping experience, without the same strong throat hit as PG. They are also renowned for their ability to create large vape clouds, but due to the liquid’s thickness VGs can require more power to vape. AG stands for aqueous glycerine. This is a VG diluent with the addition of de-ionised water to thin the mixture. Many e-liquids contain a combination of PG and VG to help vapers achieve a good ratio of vapour, flavour, and ‘throat hit’, so it’s well worth noting the mix included in the products for sale in your store.	webhose.io		“It’s important that new vapers understand that it’s not a silver bullet to give up smoking, more of a bronze one, and there might be a little trial and error at first.								
29	746b393b-b51c-315a-b5b1-2c9fafb963be	Myanmar’s Weak Legislation a “Lucky Strike” for Foreign Tobacco Giants	For international tobacco companies struggling in their home markets with low sales due to an increasing awareness about the dangers of smoking, Myanmar is an exciting business opportunity.  In July, British American Tobacco, the world’s second largest cigarette manufacturer, signed a $50 million investment deal to produce, market, and sell its brand in Myanmar over the next five years, according to AP. The company plans to construct a factory on the outskirts of Yangon. The year before, Japan Tobacco entered into a partnership with local tycoon, Kyaw Win, and is building a factory. Even China’s largest tobacco producer is planning a multi-million-dollar joint venture.  Between one-third and half of Myanmar’s 60 million people consume tobacco in some form, mostly through chewing it in betel leaves or smoking cheroots, according to Aljazeera. Although only five percent of the smoking population uses filtered cigarettes, that number is expected to rise with the emergence of a large middle class with more disposable income.  Even after years of isolation, young people in this country want to be as “cool” as those in the West. Shisha usage is now hip among Yangon youth, especially females.  “We have to go out to a restaurant or bar to smoke, and it’s fashionable,” said Ko Aung Zin Latt, 28.  “I wanted to imitate the people I saw in movies. It seemed cool then,” said Kyaw Zin Lin, a 42-year-old who began smoking at 12.  The country has a widespread tradition of smoking. Children often help their fathers light cheroots and it’s common to see boys as young as 12 buy cigarettes from street vendors. Most citizens don’t even know how bad tobacco is for their health.  “I heard that smoking can be harmful, but not everyone who smokes gets cancer,” said Khin Cho, a 37-year-old housewife. “I am OK now, and I don’t want to worry about something that hasn’t happened yet.”  Although the country ratified the WHO Framework Convention against Tobacco Control in 2004, Myanmar has failed to implement some of its guidelines – such as putting health warnings on cigarette packaging. That along with insufficient and poorly enforced legislation for the tobacco industry makes Myanmar vulnerable to companies seeking profit. Under current regulations, tobacco companies can even promote themselves under the guise of offering scholarships to children or sponsoring community projects.  “Many countries don’t have trade lawyers, financial people to challenge [these multinational corporations],” said Judith Mackay, a senior adviser to the World Lung Foundation. “In 10 years Myanmar will get up to speed [with its legislation enforcement], but right now it is very vulnerable.”	bing					That along with insufficient and poorly enforced legislation for the tobacco industry makes Myanmar vulnerable to companies seeking profit					
30	f2dccf2d-e48d-3092-bb7c-4ca277fcaa9b	Ombudsman report a smoking gun on lax tobacco control	Updated: 2018-02-26 06:37 By Judith Mackay(HK Edition) Judith Mackay recommends authorities seize the opportunity to enforce legislation against lighting up in bars and restaurants, which after all are workplaces The Ombudsman's Report launched early this month is critical of the government in nine different areas for inadequately enforcing Hong Kong's existing smoke-free laws. As in many countries and regions, the greatest non-compliance is in restaurants and bars, particularly as in Hong Kong there is currently no legal onus for licensees to comply. This is in stark contrast to almost every other jurisdiction, including Singapore and Chinese mainland cities. The reason for this goes back to the inadequacy of the 2007 smoke-free law, which penalizes only the smoker, but not the owners or managers of restaurants and bars, saunas, mahjong and tin kau premises. Even back in 2007, this was out of line with global wisdom, experience and trends. So why did Hong Kong do this? It is common knowledge this was due to pressure from a certain political party - that they would support the 2007 law only if managers were not held responsible. Pressure on the government also came from the Entertainment Business Rights Concern Group, which indicated that such establishments "face a crushing blow, with an estimate of 2,600 entertainment establishments facing a crisis of closure of business, and the 'rice bowls' of some 100,000 employees are in jeopardy". All of which, of course, proved to be complete nonsense - the opposite happened, restaurant tax returns increased 31 percent in the two years following the ban. This has led to the current situation in Hong Kong where some managers even collude with smoking patrons, warning them to "stub out" and hide ashtrays when Tobacco Control officers are seen approaching. And, to compound the problem, the Ombudsman found night-time enforcement was particularly lacking at the most relevant time for the offences to occur, with less than two raids per evening shift throughout the year 2016. The current administration inherited this deeply flawed law, but hitherto has neither attempted to amend Hong Kong's tobacco law via the Legislative Council (a daunting task nowadays) nor turned to simple solutions such as enforcing the Conditions to the Liquor Licensing Board by fining licensees where tobacco is consumed on their premises or, for repeat offenders, closing the premises. In theory, this should not even require any amendment to the liquor licensing law which currently stipulates that: "The licensee shall not permit any person to occupy or use any portion of the premises for any immoral or illegal purpose." This clearly includes the illegal act of smoking in legally designated smoke-free areas but many licensees have failed to uphold the law. Two of the Ombudsman's 11 recommendations relate to this problem, stating that the government should review licensing conditions, and "impose criminal liabilities on those venue managers who acquiesce to or condone illegal smoking on their premises". If this is done, then many of the other recommendations would become less necessary as enforcement agents would effectively grow by 8,075 (the number of bar licensees) at no extra cost to the government! Licensees are already obliged to prevent drunkenness, disorder and prostitution in their premises, none of which kill people in remotely the numbers which second-hand tobacco smoke does. If this is not done, there will be endless and expensive escalation of the number of Tobacco Control officers. This is labor legislation. Patrons are in restaurants and bars for a relatively short time compared with workers in these establishments. Given the proven harm of tobacco smoke on non-smokers, it is disgraceful that some employers have such disregard for their employees that they continue to thwart the law, and expose their own staff to known cancer-producing chemicals. I have been privileged to work closely with authorities on the mainland on national and city smoke-free legislation, particularly in Shenzhen, Beijing and Shanghai. At every opportunity, I impressed on these cities not to adopt Hong Kong's legislation but to fine managers as well as smokers. This advice was taken, and these cities' legislation is now much better than Hong Kong's. In Hong Kong, this report is an opportunity for the government to grasp this political nettle once and for all, and do two things: first, immediately amend/enforce the liquor licensing conditions and second and simultaneously start the process to amend the legislation. The government has a duty of care to protect people's health. Second-hand smoke kills. It has been proven far too many times! The government knows the deadly consequence of further delays!	rss										
31	f024f346-6948-3b22-b559-e31e4d4ba16d	FDA orders 4 cigarette brands pulled from the market - Minnesota Public Radio News	For the first time, the Food and Drug Administration has ordered a major tobacco company to stop selling brands of cigarettes.  The FDA on Tuesday ordered the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company to stop selling for brands: Camel Bold Crush, Vantage Tech 13 and the regular and menthol versions of Pall Mall Deep Set Recessed Filter cigarettes.  The FDA has ordered other cigarettes off the market before, but those actions involved much smaller companies selling much less popular cigarettes.  The agency says it took the action because R.J. Reynolds had failed to prove the brands were no more dangerous than brands that have been on the market longer.  "These decisions were based on a rigorous, science-based review designed to protect the public from the harms caused by tobacco use," Mitch Zeller, director of the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products, said in a statement. "The agency will continue to review product submissions and exercise it's legal authority and consumer protection duty to remove products from the market when they fail to meet the public health bar set forth under law."  Congress gave the FDA authority to regulate cigarettes for the first time in 2009. Among the agency's new powers are the authority to require new brands to prove they pose no more risks to smokers than cigarettes that were put on the market before Feb. 15, 2007.  The FDA says R.J. Reynolds had failed to show the four brands that have been ordered off the market do not expose smokers to more harmful chemicals, higher levels of menthol or new ingredients.	google				The FDA on Tuesday ordered the R.J.

32	95e9e378-04b6-37f5-93e3-d1c68fbe7198	Juul and the vape debate: Choosing between smokers and teens	The year was 2004, and James Monsees and Adam Bowen couldn't stop taking smoking breaks during a brainstorming session for their joint master's thesis at Stanford University's design school. It was during one of these breaks that they decided: Why not create a better way to deliver nicotine? Eleven years later, they unveiled Juul, a device that gives users a flavored nicotine fix without the smell and smoke of combustible cigarettes. It's an e-cigarette, which means it doesn't burn tobacco but rather generates an aerosol by heating a liquid that contains nicotine. Juul, along with many other e-cigarette products, has found a place in a multibillion-dollar market. According to a Bloomberg report from late June, Juul controls 68% of the e-cigarette market. In 2016, 3.2% of US adults were current e-cigarette smokers while 15.5% smoked combustible cigarettes according to the National Health Interview Survey. Younger adults were more likely to vape than older ones. Today, Monsees and Bowen are the chief product officers for the company. Ashley Gould, the chief administrative officer for Juul Labs, said they designed Juul for adult smokers trying to switch from combustible cigarettes, but data show the product's startling popularity among youth. "It's been devastating to us," Gould said. "This is not a product for youth. It's a product for adult smokers." According to a 2017 national online survey by the Truth Initiative, a nonprofit tobacco control organization, 7% of teens 15 to 17 reported having ever used a Juul. "The evidence is overwhelming today that these products appeal to kids," said Matt Myers, president of the nonprofit organization Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. But Juul Labs argues that, by helping people give up cigarettes completely, the company provides a potentially life-saving service to current smokers, two-thirds of whom will die from smoking-related illnesses. The scientific consensus, however, is still out on the long-term health effects of vaping. And new research, combined with lawsuits against Juul Labs, threatens to undermine the company's argument. "We need to talk to our kids, and at the same time, we can't forget about the 38 million American adult smokers in our country who need and deserve our support," Gould said. New research on the health effects of vaping and lawsuits against Juul Labs threaten to undermine the company's argument. Juul gone viral At Jonathan Law High School in Milford, Connecticut, Principal Francis Thompson pulled from his pocket a sleek device resembling a USB drive. It's the Juul, the most popular vape students used, he said. Vaping among teens took off so rapidly at Jonathan Law, the school had to take drastic measures. "Being a relatively new phenomenon, we didn't know a lot about vaping and its impact and its danger and, quite frankly, its popularity that continues to rise among teenagers," Thompson said. "It was causing several issues in our school bathrooms." Thompson closed all but one of the school's bathrooms. But then, kids began to brazenly vape in hallways and classrooms instead, recalls Andrew Paulus, an 18-year-old recent graduate. "It was a party setting. I saw everyone was doing it, so I was like, 'Let me just try it once just to see what this fuss is about,' " Paulus said. Emma Hudd, one of Paulus' classmates, said that teachers who didn't know any better would allow kids to plug their vapes into classroom computers to charge them. Hudd, 18, likened Juul to her generation's version of cigarettes. "We need to understand this more, because no usage of our product by youth is acceptable to us," Gould said. "I can tell you certainly though, it was not designed to look like a USB device. It was not designed to be hid by kids," she said. "This is a product that was designed by smokers for adult smokers, and that is the design ethos of the product." Bella Kacoyannakis saw the Juul on social media sites, where people would post about how "awesome" it was, she said. The first time the 20-year-old tried it, she said she was immediately drawn to its small size, simple upkeep and fruity flavors. "I like the Juul better than cigarettes because the taste is so much more pleasant. And, like, the nicotine content isn't really that much different," Kacoyannakis said. The nicotine in one Juulpod, a small disposable e-liquid cartridge that's inserted into the vaping device, is equal to that of an entire pack of cigarettes, according to the company. The rate at which a Juulpod is consumed varies among users, but can last about 200 puffs. Since Kacoyannakis switched from cigarettes to the Juul, she says, she vapes more than she used to smoke because of how convenient the device is. Gould said the company's data do not show that Juulers who switched from cigarettes are taking in more nicotine than they did when they smoked. Independent research hasn't yet confirmed Juul Labs' data. Kacoyannakis recently picked up the box of her Juul and for the first time read the warning label. "This product contains chemicals known to the state of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm," she read aloud. She had never noticed the California Proposition 65 warning before. Neither had Paulus or his friends. "On the front [of the packaging], it's big letters, J-U-U-L Juul, or it has the flavoring in the color of the pod, but no one really looks at the side to see this really small writing saying, 'Oh, caution, this is bad for you or whatever,' " he said. The Truth Initiative survey reported that 63% of young Juul users did not know that the product always contains nicotine. Gould said Juul Labs has added larger warning labels that now announce that the product contains nicotine across 20% of the space showing on a package. What's in the vape? Nicotine isn't the only ingredient in e-cigarettes, though. Studies from Harvard and Johns Hopkins researchers found that e-cigarette users wind up inhaling dangerous chemicals and toxic heavy metals along with their nicotine fix. "There's a lot that's happening with an e-cigarette besides just the nicotine and the carrier fluid. You're also inhaling these flavoring chemicals like diacetyl or cousins of diacetyl, which have been found to be harmful," said Joe Allen, an assistant professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the first author of a study on the presence of diacetyl in e-cigarettes. Much of what's known about diacetyl's effects on the lungs comes from studying the workers in a microwave popcorn packaging plant, Allen said. Twenty years ago, these workers developed a disease called bronchiolitis obliterans, or popcorn lung, after inhaling the fumes of artificial butter flavoring from open vats in their workplace. "You see a slow onset of some symptoms like wheezing, shortness of breath or coughing," Allen said. "This is a disease that is irreversible, often requiring a lung transplant." But David Abrams, a professor at the NYU College of Global Public Health who has researched smoking cessation for 40 years, doesn't see diacetyl inhalation as much of a threat for vapers. "I think this whole story of diacetyl and popcorn lung, which is true only in popcorn workers who were exposed for eight to 10 hours a day has been completely exaggerated, and it's part of what's led the public into thinking e-cigarettes are as dangerous as cigarettes," he said. Nevertheless, Abrams said the public can't be reassured completely until the US Food and Drug Administration regulates vaping products. The future of regulation Last year, the FDA announced that it would delay regulations that could have halted the sales of many e-cigarettes. Instead, the agency gave extensions to new and existing vaping products, giving them until August 2022 to submit information to support their products' safety and efficacy as switching devices. The organization decided on this timeline to "make certain that the FDA is striking an appropriate balance between regulation and encouraging development of innovative tobacco products that may be less dangerous than cigarettes," according to the news release announcing the extensions. Michael Felberbaum, an FDA spokesman, said the agency does not have any additional information regarding a regulatory timeline once these applications are submitted. Meanwhile, the agency plans to propose a series of product standards to address some of the known public health risks of these products, which includes taking a close look at flavors, he said. Greg Conley, president of the American Vaping Association, said the question facing the American public and the FDA is not whether there should be regulations but whether they should be so strict as to wipe out competition from independent vape companies. "Reasonable product standards that actually help make the products better, help instill consumer confidence, that would be fine," he said. "But what the FDA has proposed is not regulation; it is prohibition for 99% of products on the market today." Gould says reasonable regulation would entail banning candy flavoring for e-cigs like cotton candy and gummy bear, cracking down on marketing to youth and restricting purchase to buyers 21 and older. Protecting kids Even as it announced the extensions last year, FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said the agency would "redouble our efforts to protect kids from all nicotine-containing products." Felberbaum said the agency's goal is to balance public health concerns alongside the innovation of the e-cigarette industry, which "can't come at the expense of kids," he added. In April, after telling CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta that the organization would be taking enforcement actions "very soon" against companies believed to be marketing products to young people, Gottlieb announced a "blitz" on retailers for violations related to sales of e-cigarettes to minors. The agency said it sent Juul Labs a request to submit documents related to product marketing and research, including information about "youth initiation and use." In July, the company was hit with multiple lawsuits that allege Juul Labs intentionally targets teens in its marketing. Prior to the lawsuits, Gould said the company took seriously the criticism of its 2015 launch campaign, which used young-looking models. The company had also announced that it would no longer use models on social media platforms, instead focusing on testimonials from adult smokers who switched to Juul. "That campaign in the end, we felt, did not help us achieve our mission of speaking to adult smokers to provide them information about an alternative to cigarettes," she said. Juul uses age verification measures on its website, but Gould said 90% of the company's sales are at the retail level, which is more difficult to regulate. Paulus, the recent high school graduate, says enforcing stricter age laws won't stop underage users from getting their hands on Juuls. "I'm 18, and a freshman, sophomore, junior -- if they really want to smoke or use a Juul, they could ask me or ask anyone in the senior class that's over 18, and they could easily just give them money, go to a store, pick it up for them," he said. Other approaches target the schools where the Juuling problem is prevalent. One independent organization that has developed an e-cigarette prevention program for middle and high school students is the Coordinated Approach to Child Health, or CATCH. It includes four lessons with topics that include e-cigarette ingredients, marketing techniques and skills for refusing e-cigarettes. Ashley Monteiro, a student at Wareham Middle School in Massachusetts, said that before taking the class, she thought e-cigarettes looked "pretty cool" and the flavors might taste good. But since learning about the use of artificial flavorings and chemicals in vapes, she's no longer interested. For Hudd, a 2018 grad of Jonathan Law High School, the solution to the vaping craze is to escape its epicenter. "I'm happy I'm leaving high school so that I can get out of here and away from all the Juuling," she said.	webhose.io			According to a 2017 national online survey by the Truth Initiative, a nonprofit tobacco control organization, 7% of teens 15 to 17 reported having ever used a Juul							Studies from Harvard and Johns Hopkins researchers found that e-cigarette users wind up inhaling dangerous chemicals and toxic heavy metals along with their nicotine fix
33	b3146398-2eab-3807-b98e-8adea33b2b69	Singapore to become first country to ban ads for sugary drinks	World SINGAPORE: Singapore will become the first country in the world to ban ads for the most unhealthy sugary drinks in its latest move to combat rising diabetes rates, the health ministry said on Thursday. Products deemed "less healthy" must now display labels grading their nutritional and sugar content, with those considered to be most unhealthy banned from appearing in ads across all media platforms, including broadcast, print and online channels. "This aims to reduce the influence of such advertisements on consumer preferences," the ministry said, calling the ban a world-first. It added that the measures were only a start and it will continue to explore the possibility of a sugar tax or ban. "We urge SSB (sugar-sweetened beverages) manufacturers to consider reformulating their drinks to contain less sugar even as we further study these measures," it said. The ministry said it will obtain industry feedback in the coming months on how to implement the measures and announce more details next year. According to the International Diabetes Federation, 13.7 percent of adults suffer from diabetes in Singapore, one of the highest rates among developed nations. Other marketing bans around the world have focused on restricting children’s exposure to junk food ads. SINGAPORE: Singapore will become the first country in the world to ban ads for the most unhealthy sugary drinks in its latest move to combat rising diabetes rates, the health ministry said on Thursday. Products deemed "less healthy" must now display labels grading their nutritional and sugar content, with those considered to be most unhealthy banned from appearing in ads across all media platforms, including broadcast, print and online channels. "This aims to reduce the influence of such advertisements on consumer preferences," the ministry said, calling the ban a world-first. It added that the measures were only a start and it will continue to explore the possibility of a sugar tax or ban. "We urge SSB (sugar-sweetened beverages) manufacturers to consider reformulating their drinks to contain less sugar even as we further study these measures," it said. The ministry said it will obtain industry feedback in the coming months on how to implement the measures and announce more details next year.

The report has been called one of the most important documents in U.S. public health history. While not the first to raise the alarm about smoking, it gave momentum to the push for tobacco controls. The surgeon general has periodically issued more smoking reports, and a new one is due out next week. Fifty years after its original publication, the AP is making this story available to its subscribers.  WASHINGTON (AP) — Heavy cigarette smoking is the principal cause of cancer of the lungs and the larynx and a health hazard so grave as to call for remedial action, a blue-ribbon science panel concluded today.  The nature of that action was not spelled out. However, Surgeon General Luther Terry of the U.S. Public Health Service said his agency will move promptly to recommend specific steps of the kind urged by the science group. Meanwhile, he told a news conference: "I would advise anyone to discontinue smoking cigarettes."  The 10-man special advisory committee on smoking and health took 14 months to evaluate more than 8,000 studies of the effect of smoking on health.  It undertook no fresh research but decided available evidence shows that cigarette smoking far outweighs all other causes of lung cancer and cancer of the larynx — in men and perhaps in women.  It had no such clear-cut indictment of cigarette smoking in the area of heart and blood vessel disease or lesser aliments sometimes associated with smoking.  But, broadly, the panel took the view that the more you smoke the more you risk early death.  The special group was not requested to make specific recommendations for laws or regulations to offset smoking hazards but it concluded: "Cigarette smoking is a health hazard of sufficient importance in the United States to warrant appropriate remedial action."  After releasing the report, Terry declared that there will be "no footdragging" in seeking possible remedial steps.  In another major conclusion the committee of scientists said: "In view of the continuing and mounting evidence from many sources, it is the judgment of the committee that cigarette smoking contributes substantially to mortality from certain specific diseases and to the over-all death rate. "  The report, which ran to about 150,000 words and several hundred pages, hit hardest at cigarette smoking as being what it termed a significant cause of lung cancer, chronic bronchitis, and cancer of the larynx, or voice box. The committee was more reserved in linking cigarette smoking with heart disease and circulatory disorders, at least as to any cause-and-effect relationship.  The report said in this respect: "Male cigarette smokers have a higher death rate from coronary artery disease than non-smoking males, but it is not clear that the association has causal significance." But it said also that an association has been established between cigarette smoking in men and higher rates of coronary disease, and it asserted: "It is . more prudent to assume that the established association between cigarette smoking and coronary disease has a causative meaning than to suspend judgment until no uncertainty remains." As for lung cancer, the report said that in men, cigarette smoking far outweighs other possible causes of the malady and "the data for women, though less extensive, point in the same direction."  " It said the risk of developing lung cancer for pipe smokers and cigarette smokers is greater than for nonsmokers "but much less than for cigarette smokers." For various specific diseases, Terry said in a statement, the committee's findings were that cigar and pipe smoking have little significance in comparison with cigarettes.  But while it found much physical menace in smoking, the committee reported that there are benefits in the area of mental health and ease, saying "the habit originates in a search for contentment."  As regards other diseases, the box score of the report ran this way:  1. Cancer of the esophagus — there is evidence of an association with smoking, but cause and effect have not been decided on the basis of present evidence.  2. Cancer of the urinary bladder — an association with cigarette smoking but not enough evidence to establish a cause-and-effect link.  4. Peptic ulcer (including ulcers of the stomach and of the duodenum which links the stomach with the intestines)_an association with cigarette smoking but no cause and effect yet established.  5. Amblyopia, dimness of vision unexplained by any bodily defect — an apparent relationship between this ailment and pipe and cigar smoking — but no cause-and-effect link yet made.  6. Cirrhosis of the liver: — there is increased mortality from this among smokers, but the evidence is not sufficient to establish the cause and effect link.  7. Infant birth weight — women who smoke cigarettes during pregnancy tend to have babies of lower than usual birth weight. But Information is lacking on the mechanism by which this decrease in birth rate is produced.  The report said that available evidence suggests the existence of some constitutional differences between smokers and nonsmokers but it is still too meager to permit a conclusion.  As to mortality among cigarette smokers the report declared that one study has shown that the death rate for smokers of cigarettes only is about 70 percent higher than that for nonsmokers, and it added: "The death rates increase with the amount smoked."  The report said that in most parts of the nation cigarette smoking contributes to chronic lung and bronchial ailments much more than does air pollution.  Terry told newsmen who were given an hour and a half to study the report before its release that it "has provided us with the most comprehensive compilation and analysis ever undertaken on the relationship between smoking and health."  "You will have noted," Terry said, "that the committee's report does not cover what 'appropriate remedial action' might be. It was not a part of the responsibility of this committee to make such recommendations." But Terry added: "I can assure the committee that we will move promptly to determine what remedial health measures the public health service should take. Secretary (of welfare) Celebreeze has asked me to analyze the report and make recommendations to him.  "The staff of the public health service is only now receiving the report and I shall, of course, want their views before making our recommendations. I am sure that other departments and agencies of the federal government, along with non-federal agencies, will also take the report under consideration promptly."  Asked whether the committee's report could now be considered to represent the government's official thinking on the subject of smoking and health, Terry replied that it could not. But he added: "On the other hand, having had the opportunity to go over it, I can assure you it is an excellent report."  Asked when government action of any kind would be taken on the report, Terry replied: "It would be inappropriate for me to try to say when ... but in our (Public Health Service) department this matter is considered of such importance that I do not believe there will be any foot-dragging."  In saying that on the basis of the committee's findings he as a doctor would recommend against smoking, Terry said that "in the light of a clear-cut association" between smoking and lung cancer as found by the committee, he would say that If anyone continued to smoke "he should do it with a recognition that he is subjecting himself to a definite health risk."  The surgeon general said copies of the report are being sent to members of congress. "And to the heads of other federal agencies who have an interest in the findings and conclusions." He added that copies are also being mailed to the governors of the states, the state health offices, voluntary health agencies, representatives of industry and labor, and others concerned. And within the next few weeks, he said, the report will be sent to every physician and osteopath in the country.  In another of its major findings the document said: "Cigarette smoking is associated with a 70 percent increase in the age-specific death rates of males and to a lesser extent to increased death rates of females.  "The total number of excess deaths casually related to cigarette smoking in the U.S. population cannot be accurately estimated." As regards the illnesses in which it declared cigarette smoking was a particular hazard, the report put it this way:  Lung cancer — "Cigarette smoking is casually related to lung cancer in men; the magnitude of the effect of cigarette smoking far outweighs all other factors. The data for women, though less extensive, point in the same direction.  "The risk of developing lung cancer increases with duration of smoking and the number of cigarettes smoked per day, and is disminished by discontinuing smoking.  "In comparison with non-smokers, average male smokers of cigarettes have approximately a 9-to-10-fold risk of developing lung cancer and heavy smokers at least a 20-fold risk." Chronic bronchitis and pulmonary emphysema (an enlargement of the air sacs of the lungs which may make breathing difficult and possibly bring on heart failure) — "Cigarette smoking is the most important of the causes of chronic bronchitis in the United States and increases the risk of dying from chronic bronchitis and emphysema.  "A relationship exists between cigarette smoking and emphysema but it has not been established that the relationship is causal. Studies demonstrate that fatalities from this disease are infrequent among non-smokers." The committee said cigarette smoking "does not appear to cause asthma." And it added: "Although death certification shows that cigarette smokers have a moderately increased risk of death from influenza and pneumonia, an association of cigarette smoking and infectious diseases is not otherwise substantiated."  Speaking on the subject of "the tobacco habit and nicotine" the panel reported: "The habitual use of tobacco is related primarily to psychological and social drives, reinforced and perpetuated by pharmacological (drug) actions of nicotine.  "Social stimulation appears to play a major role in a young person's early and first experiments with smoking. No scientific evidence supports the popular hypothesis that smoking among adolescents is an expression of rebellion against authority."  Then the report added: "Individual stress appears to be associated more with fluctuations in the amount of smoking than with the prevalence of smoking. The overwhelming evidence indicates that smoking — its beginning, habituation, and occasional discontinuation — is to a very large extent psychologically and socially determined."  The committee said: "In general, the greater the number of cigarettes smoked daily, the higher the death rate (from all causes). "For men who smoke fewer than 10 cigarettes a day, according to the seven prospective studies, the death rate from all causes is about 40 percent higher than for non-smokers.  "For those who smoke from 10 to 19 cigarettes a day it is about 70 percent higher than for non-smokers; for those who smoke 20 to 39 a day, 90 percent higher; and for those who smoke 40 or more, it is 120 percent higher.  "Cigarette smokers who stopped smoking before enrolling in the seven studies have a death rate about 40 percent higher than non-smokers, as against 70 percent higher than for current cigarette smokers. Men who began smoking before age 20 have substantially higher death rate than those who began after 25 ... "  Of smokers' personality it said: "A clear-cut smoker's personality has not emerged from the results so far published. "While smokers differ from non-smokers in a variety of characteristics, none of the studies has shown a single variable which is shown solely in one group and is completely absent in another. Nor has any single variable been verified in a sufficiently large proportion of smokers and in sufficiently few non-smokers to consider it an 'essential' aspect of smoking."	bing

The streaming content giant also says information about smoking will be included as part of its ratings. Matt Rourke / AP There's a scene in the hit Netflix series Stranger Things where the skeptical police chief, Chief Jim Hopper, is at his desk chomping on an apple. He listens to a theory that a local teen may have been kidnapped by Russian spies. Fed up, he spits out the fruit, sticks a cigarette in his mouth and lights up. But Netflix has now pledged to cut down on moments like this: The streaming content giant announced Wednesday that it will stub out depictions of smoking across all of its original shows aimed at younger viewers. The announcement comes on the heels of a new report by the anti-smoking group Truth Initiative released earlier this week. The study looked at several of the most popular programs among 15-to-24-year-olds and found that the amount of tobacco imagery in them has more than tripled in the past year. The group's research shows smoking and e-cigarette depictions were most prevalent on Netflix, blowing away portrayals on cable or broadcast TV. The biggest offender? Season 2 of Stranger Things. The researchers found that 100% of the episodes they analyzed of the show — a supernatural story about adolescents, set in the 1980s — included tobacco use. The Truth Initiative timed the release of its now-annual report to coincide with Thursday's debut of season 3 of Stranger Things. In a statement, Netflix told Variety that it will not show smoking or e-cigarette use in future shows with ratings of TV-14 or below, as well as all films rated PG-13 or below, except for "reasons of historical or factual accuracy." The company added that it would also limit depictions of smoking in projects with higher age ratings, "unless it's essential to the creative vision of the artist or because it's character-defining (historically or culturally important.)" Netflix also said information about smoking will be included as part of its ratings. The Truth Initiative noted that the pervasive rise of smoking on the small screen could pose a significant threat to a new generation of young Americans. "Based on estimated viewership of these programs, results suggest that approximately 28 million young people were exposed to tobacco through television and streaming programs in these most popular shows alone," the group said. "That exposure is a significant public health concern, because viewing tobacco use in on-screen entertainment media is a critical factor associated with young people starting to smoke." A 2014 report by the U.S. Surgeon General concluded "an R-rating for movies with smoking would avert one million tobacco deaths among today's children and adolescents."	webhose.io										
36	3de8a87d-871e-30e0-8b41-e9ace1fb54a4	E-cigarettes removed from banned list for county workers	Nye County employees will be able to use electronic cigarettes within the county’s properties.  Nye County commissioners voted last week to remove the devices, commonly called e-cigarettes, from the list of tobacco products that are prohibited within any building owned, leased and utilized by Nye County.  It was the only amendment for the Nye County Personnel Policy Manual approved Dec. 6.  Electronic cigarettes are not a tobacco product and many use them to kick the habit of using tobacco, much like patches or gum, Nye County Commissioner Lorinda Wichman said.  “Electronic cigarettes are not tobacco use and they are a method to eliminate tobacco use and for people to quit smoking,” Wichman said.  Wichman said she is the only commissioner on the board who uses e-cigarettes.  Under the original rules for use of tobacco in the county’s personnel policy, the prohibition extended to areas that are routinely or regularly used by employees, including but not limited to work areas, restrooms, hallways, employee lounges, cafeterias, conference and meeting rooms, lobbies and vehicles Nye County owns or uses.  The county also shall not allow the use of tobacco products during staff and training meetings, according to the documents.  “I’m spending as much as eight or 10 hours in county vehicles and I would not have voted for that,” Wichman said.  The section in the manual titled ‘Tobacco Use’ was adopted at the April meeting. During that meeting, commissioners discussed medical marijuana use and policies, but didn’t discuss the use of tobacco products.  At the meeting last week, commissioners also adopted the language for information technology policies and social media policies for Nye County employees.  The language for information technology policies specifies guidelines for privacy of employees when using the county’s electronic and telecommunication properties, systems, or services; prohibited use. The language for social media policies specifies guidelines for employee monitoring, authorized social networking, personal blogs and social networking sites.  “It was standard language changes to keep the manual moving forward with new technology,” Wichman said.	webhose.io

38	bff96406-d5e6-3be6-b6d4-4f6189f6a4f0	Youth Smoking Decline Stalls; Vaping May Be Cause	Cigarette smoking rates have stopped falling among U.S. kids, and health officials believe youth vaping is responsible. For decades, the percentage of high school and middle school students who smoked cigarettes had been declining fairly steadily. For the past three years, it has flattened, according to new numbers released Monday. There may be several reasons, but a recent boom in vaping is the most likely explanation, said Brian King of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "We were making progress, and now you have the introduction of a product that is heavily popular among youth that has completely erased that progress," King said. The CDC findings come from a national survey conducted last spring of more than 20,000 middle and high school students. It asked if they had used any tobacco products in the previous month. Some of the findings had been released before, including the boom in vaping. Experts attribute the vaping increase to the exploding popularity of newer versions of e-cigarettes, like those by Juul Labs Inc. of San Francisco. The products resemble computer flash drives, can be recharged in USB ports and can be used discreetly — including in school bathrooms and even in classrooms. According to the new CDC data, about 8 percent of high schoolers said they had recently smoked cigarettes in 2018, and about 2 percent of middle schoolers did. Those findings were about the same seen in similar surveys in 2016 and 2017. It also found that about 2 in 5 high school students who used a vaping or tobacco product used more than one kind, and that the most common combination was e-cigarettes and cigarettes. Also, about 28 percent of high school e-cigarette users said they vaped 20 or more days in the previous month — nearly a 40 percent jump from the previous year. Smoking, the nation's leading cause of preventable illness, is responsible for more than 480,000 deaths each year. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration bans the sale of e-cigarettes and tobacco products to those under 18. E-cigarettes are generally considered better than cigarettes for adults who are already addicted to nicotine. But health officials have worried for years that electronic cigarettes could lead kids to switch to smoking traditional cigarettes. "I think the writing is on the wall," with research increasingly suggesting e-cigarettes are becoming a gateway to regular cigarettes, said Megan Roberts, an Ohio State University researcher. There is, however, some split of opinion among health researchers. Some had linked e-cigarettes to an unusually large drop in teen smoking a few years ago, and they say it's not clear to what extent the decline in smoking has stalled or to what degree vaping is to blame. Cigarette smoking is still declining in some states. And another large survey found that smoking has continued to drop among 12th graders, though not in younger school kids. "It's not clear yet what's going on and it's best to not jump to any conclusions," said David Levy, a Georgetown University researcher. In a statement, a Juul spokeswoman said the company has taken steps to prevent children from using its products and supports prohibiting sales of e-cigarettes to anyone under 21.

The sale of `gutka` and tobacco, however, will not be allowed. Commissioner Food Safety and Drug Administration Anita Singh has issued the order saying that the exemption is for plain paan masala. The ban on the manufacture, storage and sale of tobacco and nicotine-free pan masala/gutkha in the state will continue unchanged. The state government has also allowed stationery and book shops to open in the green and orange zones, maintaining social distancing norms. Though many government and private schools have started giving online classes amid the lockdown, students claimed the unavailability of books was affecting the studies. The sale of books and stationery has been welcomed by parents and students who said that online classes, in the absence of books, were making studying difficult for them. "We have been getting queries from parents on how students can study without books. The concrete studies can start only when students have books," said Rita Kaushal, a teacher in a local secondary school.	email

Among those communities receiving grants are New Bedford and Fall River. According to a DPH news release, Fall River is getting $98,000 (also serving Attleboro, Berkley, Dighton, Norton, Somerset, Swansea, Taunton, and Westport) while New Bedford is receiving $90,000 (also serving Acushnet, Dartmouth, Fairhaven, Freetown, Marion, and Rochester.) “Massachusetts continues to develop comprehensive approaches to reduce tobacco and nicotine use among young people and adults,” Secretary of Health and Human Services Marylou Sudders said in the release. “Local communities throughout the state will use this funding to build and strengthen their efforts to educate the public about the health effects of tobacco use and exposure to secondhand smoke, and direct individuals to cessation resources.” The funding, a combination of state and federal dollars, will help communities establish and maintain comprehensive tobacco control programs based on the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Best Practices designed to: • Protect youth from exposure to tobacco and vaping industry tactics and prevent youth initiation of tobacco/nicotine use • Protect residents from secondhand smoke • Ensure all Massachusetts users of tobacco/nicotine have access to cessation resources • Identify tobacco-related disparities and target efforts toward those disproportionately affected "For more than 20 years, DPH’s efforts have resulted in significant progress in preventing tobacco use and helping smokers quit for good,” said Public Health Commissioner Monica Bharel. “Despite this progress, these awards come at a time when vaping rates among youth are 9 times higher than adults.” On July 27, Gov. Charlie Baker signed a bill which raises the legal age to buy tobacco products statewide from 18 to 21. The new law broadens existing prohibitions on public smoking to include e-cigarettes and prohibits the use of tobacco products on the grounds of any public or private primary, secondary, or vocational school. Additionally, pharmacies, hospitals, or other entities that offer health care services or employ any licensed health care providers are prohibited from selling tobacco products. Earlier this month, DPH launched its first statewide public information campaign to educate parents of middle and high school-aged children about the dangers of vape pens and e-cigarettes. The campaign, The New Look of Nicotine Addiction, seeks to spread the word that these high-tech products are harmful and that they contain nicotine which can damage a teenager’s developing brain and lead to addiction.

In the email obtained by the ABC, Ambulance Tasmania told staff there were shortages due to unpredicted leave and more shortages were expected in the coming weeks. Health and Community Services Union state secretary Tim Jacobson said northern staff were being asked to cover the south. "Calling people from Launceston to work in Hobart just moves the problem from Hobart to Launceston," he said. "The Government doesn't seem to understand that we have a major problem, and the epicentre isn't Hobart, it is everywhere." In a statement, an Ambulance Tasmania spokesman said no leave had been cancelled, but staff had been asked to voluntarily reschedule leave if they were able to, due to higher than anticipated unplanned leave. Remote students facing longer bus trips Students at a remote Tasmanian school could soon be forced to sit on a bus for two and a half hours a day to get to and from school, due to uncertainty over a school bus contract. The Mountain Heights School at Queenstown on the west coast currently has two bus lines, one takes students to Zeehan in the north and the other taking children to Strahan in the west. The contract for the bus to Zeehan expires at the end of this year and there is currently no certainty about what will happen with the route. Infrastructure Minister Michael Ferguson said the Government stepped in to find an operator for the school to Zeehan service when the last operator pulled out, and said the community would be supported so it was no worse off. Weather For forecast for Tasmania is for showers about the west and far south, with light showers about the north. Mainly fine elsewhere. Winds will be west to north-westerly becoming fresh and gusty during the day. Showers are also forecast for tomorrow with snow to 600 metres in the afternoon.	google										
42	2547408e-e6f7-3985-809a-a9ffcded42f6	Parliament: Bill tabled to raise minimum smoking age from 18 to 21	SINGAPORE - Singapore took its first legal step towards raising the minimum smoking age from 18 to 21, with a new bill presented in Parliament on Monday.  If passed, the bill to amend the Tobacco (Control of Advertisements and Sale) Act will also make it illegal for people to own imitation tobacco products such as e-cigarettes.  Currently, it is against the law to import, distribute, sell or offer to sell such products. With the changes, those who own e-cigarettes can also be fined up to $2,000.  The bill was tabled by Health Minister Gan Kim Yong for the first reading. It will be debated at a future sitting.  In a statement attached to the bill, the health ministry said that raising the minimum legal age is intended "to reduce, with a view to ultimately eliminating, the opportunities for the young to be tempted and take up smoking before attaining 21 years of age".  In Singapore, the years between age 18 and 21 are when nearly half of smokers start to light up on a regular basis. The average age at which people began to lit up has also gone down, from 17 in 2001 to 16 in 2013.  Nee Soon GRC MP Louis Ng, who is a former smoker, called the proposed amendment a "crucial step forward".  "I started smoking when I was about 18 years old," he said. "Research by the World Health Organisation shows that people who don't pick up smoking before age 21 are unlikely to ever start."  Medical experts welcomed the proposed changes, but said they should be complemented by other anti-smoking measures.  This includes more prominent public campaigns such as deterrent ads on buses, and higher taxes such as in Australia where a packet of cigarettes can cost over AUD$30, said Dr K. Thomas Abraham, chief executive of Sata CommHealth which conducts community health programmes. Stronger enforcement action is also required, he added.  Dr Tan Kok Kuan, a resident doctor at Dr Tan & Partners @ Novena, said though that there is a case to be made for permitting certain types of e-cigarettes that contain tobacco but no flavorings.  These provide smokers with the nicotine fix, but are less likely to entice young smokers, he said.  "I'm of the opinion that being 100 per cent smoke free is not possible," he said. "It makes sense to allow products which are not healthy, but are less harmful than the ones we currently have."

43	e137ddb1-bde2-3ad2-b427-ba0b8c608e32	E-cigarettes banned in New York City	New York City has voted to extend its strict smoking ban to e-cigarettes, barring them from bars, restaurants, parks, beaches and other public places.  The bill is expected to be signed by Mayor Michael Bloomberg in the coming days and will then come into effect after 180 days.  E-cigarettes are battery-powered and deliver doses of nicotine and other additives via aerosol.  They are sold as a safer alternative to traditional cigarettes that can even help smokers quit their habit.	bing	New York City has voted to extend its strict smoking ban to e-cigarettes

According to researchers from University at Buffalo, smoking abstinence doesn’t greatly affect the motivation for food. “We found that the motivations for cigarettes, food and water do not interact very much,” said Stephen Tiffany from the university’s department of psychology. “The results suggest that smoking abstinence does not affect the motivation for food and water”. The study, published in the journal Drug and Alcohol Dependence, used cues and actual money to learn how much smokers might spend for cigarettes, food and water during abstinence. The results provide new insights for how different systems control motivation and reward. Food does not become more appealing during those times when a smoker is in a smoke-free environment or otherwise can’t smoke. “If you’re on an airplane and can’t smoke, you’re not likely to be spending more money than usual on snacks,” said Tiffany. For the current study, 50 participants, all smokers who had abstained for 12 hours, had money to spend on their choices. Tiffany and Jennifer Betts, the study’s co-author, sat those participants in front of a box with a sliding door. Inside the box was one of three items: their favourite brand of cigarette, a candy bar they previously acknowledged as liking, or a cup of water. During the study, non-abstinent smokers spent more money for cigarettes than for food. And more money for food than for water. Abstinent smokers spent even more for cigarettes, but they didn’t spend for food or for water. “When people are abstinent from cigarettes their craving tends to go up, but they don’t become hypersensitive to the cue,” said Tiffany. People don’t relapse randomly. They relapse in the presence of opportunities to use which can be triggered by cues, the researchers noted.	web

Supreme Court refuses case	Arthur Gallagher, a smoker, challenged a ban on lighting up in city buildings, parks, and playgrounds in Clayton, Mo. The Supreme Court turned away the case Monday.  The US Supreme Court declined on Monday to take up a case testing whether smokers have a constitutional right to light up in a public park.  The high court turned aside the appeal without comment.  The question arose in a lawsuit filed against the City of Clayton, Mo., and its officials after the Board of Aldermen passed a 2010 ordinance prohibiting smoking in city buildings, parks, and playgrounds.  Arthur Gallagher, a smoker, sued the city and its officials claiming the ban violated a fundamental right to consume ignited tobacco. He said he was a regular visitor to city parks who “ecstatically enjoys smoking tobacco products while doing so.”  “We decline Gallagher’s invitation to declare smoking a fundamental right,” the three-judge panel of the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals said in its decision.  The court also rejected Gallagher’s argument that the city had no rational reason justifying a ban on smoking in an open-air park because secondhand smoke would quickly dissipate. No member of the public could possibly be harmed, Gallagher had insisted.  When the board enacted the ban, it cited public health and safety, litter reduction, and preserving the aesthetics of city property. (The city did not assert a desire to prevent fires as a reason to ban smoking in public buildings and parks, the appeals court noted.)  The board relied on a 1999 National Cancer Institute report that said secondhand smoke is responsible for the early deaths of 53,000 Americans each year, the appeals court said. The board also considered a 2006 report from the US surgeon general that concluded there was no risk-free level of exposure to secondhand smoke.  Gallagher said the reports addressed indoor secondhand smoke, not outdoor secondhand smoke.  The appeals court rejected Gallagher’s argument. To survive the relatively easy standard of rational basis review, the city must only show a plausible reason to justify the new ordinance.  “We need not determine whether outdoor secondhand smoke exposure actually causes harm,” the appeals court said. “Because the City reasonably could believe this to be true, the Ordinance survives rational basis review.”  The case was Gallagher v. City of Clayton (12-1122).	bing	The question arose in a lawsuit filed against the City of Clayton, Mo., and its officials after the Board of Aldermen passed a 2010 ordinance prohibiting smoking in city buildings, parks, and playgrounds								a 2006 report from the US surgeon general that concluded there was no risk-free level of exposure to secondhand smoke

It is also among those few which have welcomed the decision of the Sindh government to put a ban on the use of plastic bags by implementing the government’s initiative. By reducing the use of plastic bags and growing trees in large numbers, we can play a very vital role in minimizing the environmental hazards. The government cannot bring changes alone; it always needs public support to successfully run and implement its drive. These views were expressed by the adviser to the provincial chief minister on law, environment and coastal development, Barrister Murtaza Wahab, on Wednesday. He was addressing as chief guest a seminar, titled ‘Environmental Awareness and Plantation Drive 2019’, which was held at the Karachi University Business Administration’s auditorium. The seminar was organised to create awareness regarding Karachi’s environmental issues and what would be the role of the masses to make environment clean and green. Wahab shared that during recent heavy rainfall he had witnessed that sewerage lines were unable to clear the rainwater as most of them were filled with plastic bags and solid waste material due to which the drainage system was chocked. “Public after using plastic bags carelessly throw it away and later it becomes problem for the governments and other concerned departments and agencies. We have to create awareness among the masses that they should not use plastic bags anymore and put their garbage in the dumping centres.” He mentioned that the provincial and federal governments worked on legislation and after debating every aspect of proposed law they passed it to implement for the betterment of the society. However, he said that we also have to create awareness regarding the laws so that they could be enforced in letter and spirit. He said that laws are passed to facilitate public and people should also put them into practice; otherwise, society would not get any benefit from such laws. “If, we plant a tree today, it will benefit our children in future. We shouldn’t be happy after planting a sapling only. We also have to take good care of the plant until it grows completely.” Wahab urged that every citizen should take part in the plantation drive and the Sindh government would provide whatever was needed to plant a sapling. KU Vice Chancellor Professor Dr Khalid Mahmood Iraqi said that Karachi was facing many environmental issues, severely affecting its biophysical environment as well as human health. He further said that air pollution, lack of proper waste management infrastructure and degradation of water bodies were major environmental issues in Karachi. He observed that at the present rate of development and economic growth we were rapidly depleting the natural resource base on which man’s existence depended. “Karachi University has a commitment to a better environmental future of the country. This university is a history setter and now we have set a history by following the right roadmap and setting healthy traditions in the campus.” Dr Iraqi added that the University of Karachi was developing linkages in the field of environment and working on installing pollution control technology through consultation and technical guidance in the campus. He mentioned that trees and plants were the prime source of environmental purification and beautification and played an essential role on a grand scale as well as on local level. Earlier, Professor Dr Moazzam Ali Khan, through a presentation, shed light on Karachi’s civic problems. He informed the audience that 75 percent of total solid waste collected from various parts of the city could be recycled and reused and there was no harm is using recycled items. He said that the city required around 100 million gallons of additional water per day (MGD) after every five years to bridge the gap of demand and supply. In 2015, the requirement of the water in Karachi was over 1,100 MGD from several sources, but it was only getting 650 MGD and still there was a huge gap in demand and supply. “Our air is polluted, we are facing water shortfall while there isn’t proper treatment of the sewerage system. This city produces 20,000 metric tons of solid waste daily and most of them are left unattended or being burnt in the open.” He said that this was our everyday business and it was everyone’s business that was why we all must have to work together to bring about change in the society. We should not throw our garbage outside our homes and should act as sensible citizens. He said that environmental issues were a subject of attitude and there was need to change attitude to bring about positive changes in the society. Professor Dr Moazzam Khan added that rather than blaming governments and other relevant agencies, citizens should take some initiatives to make their areas clean and green. Later, Barrister Wahab, Dr Iraqi, deans of all faculties, Iqra University VC Dr Waseem Qazi planted a sapling to launch a three-day plantation drive on the campus. All the departments, centres and institutions of the varsity also participated in the drive along with students and faculty members.

47	0ec3c7b5-5f39-3c3b-8a48-2567d05f8edb	ITG Brands Announces New Leadership	GREENSBORO, N.C. — ITG Brands LLC will have a new president, effective Nov. 7.  Veteran consumer packaged goods (CPG) and tobacco industry leader Dan Carr will join ITG as president, assuming oversight of the company's sales, marketing and operations functions. He will report to ITG Brand's Chief Executive Officer David Taylor, who will continue to serve as CEO.  "Dan comes to ITG Brands with a powerful combination of fast-moving consumer packaged goods experience and extensive tobacco qualifications in both smokeless and cigars," Taylor said.  Carr began his career in the CPG with Scott Paper, which later merged with Kimberly-Clark Corp. In 1996, he joined General Cigar and became vice president of sales in 1998. He went on to accept positions of increasing responsibility and leadership that broadened his scope to marketing, operations and supply chain, ultimately serving as president of General Cigar, which was fully acquired by Swedish Match in 2005 and now owned by Scandinavian Tobacco Group.  "Dan has aligned teams of varying sizes and has done so multiple times in the tobacco industry," added Taylor. "He understands distribution channels, regulatory challenges and the different levers that can be pulled to drive growth. He recognizes what it takes to drive a U.S. business in collaboration with a global strategy."  Carr received a bachelor's degree in Business Administration from Ramapo College of New Jersey. His education and accreditation background also includes Harvard Business School's Advanced Management Program.  He serves on various boards including more than 15 years for the Cigar Association of America. There he is a two-term chairman. He also serves the University of Richmond's Robins School of Business Executive Advisory Council, and more than 10 years as a board member for the Tobacco Merchants Association.  Greensboro-based ITG Brands was formed in 2015. It is the third-largest tobacco manufacturer and marketer of tobacco products in the United States. Its cigarette brands include Winston, Kool, USA Gold and Maverick, and cigar brands Dutch Masters, Backwoods and Phillies. It also sells blu e-Cigarettes.	bing

Contrary to the view of health officials in the United States that using e-cigarettes could pose detrimental effects to health, those from the United Kingdom think otherwise. In fact, they believe that e-cigarettes are less harmful than normal cigarettes and these could be used as an important tool in helping most smokers quit tobacco altogether.  Public Health England (PHE), a group of health officials from more than 70 organizations in the United Kingdom, released an independent review of the evidence that assessed the effects of e-cigarettes to health.  E-cigarettes are 95 percent less harmful to the body because these do not contain free radicals, PHE found.  The agency believes that using e-cigarettes as a "stop smoking" aid can be helpful since these provide a high-nicotine hit that other nicotine delivery products do not give. This will help smokers work their way down to a zero dosage, effectively weaning off from nicotine addiction completely.  In the assessment report released, key findings show that smokers who tried other methods to quit smoking and had no result can be urged to try using e-cigarettes instead. This can be done through the help of health professionals who can provide behavioral support.  The use of e-cigarettes can help reduce smoking-related diseases, health inequalities and death, the officials reiterated. E-cigarettes can be used by those who can't abruptly stop smoking or those who don't want to stop.  Health officials also found that e-cigarettes can help people quit smoking and actually reduce the consumption of cigarettes. Though more research is needed, the officials said that there is evidence that e-cigarettes can encourage quitting or reducing cigarette consumption even among those who do not intend to quit smoking.  "We believe this review will prove a valuable resource, explaining the relative risks and benefits of e-cigarettes, in terms of harm reduction when compared with cigarettes and as an aid to quitting," said [PDF] Duncan Selbie, chief executive of PHE.  "We will continue to monitor the position and will add to the evidence base and guidance going forward," he added.	bing		Health officials in the United Kingdom believe that e-cigarettes could be a helpful tool in helping people quit smoking								
49	8c707dc5-985e-30c0-acbb-d16571f1ce7e	Implementing a smoke-free hospital site policy	Turning an entire hospital site into a smoke-free environment sounds like a daunting project but good communication and careful preparation can lead to success.  In 2013 NICE recommended that hospital sites become smoke-free. The guidance noted that smoking cessation can have considerable health benefits, and patients in hospital who quit benefit from shorter lengths of stay and fewer complications.  Since 2013 our trust’s policy included a partial ban on smoking across the site with the provision of three external smoking shelters for patient and visitor use only. All staff, patients, carers and the general public had access to the on-site or community-based stop smoking services. Our new policy, launched at the beginning of this year, aims to achieve a smoke-free site whereby smoking is not allowed on any part of the trust’s grounds.  We started planning the policy nine months before its launch. A neighbouring trust had decided to launch its policy on the same date, while two other local trusts had already done so. We were able to learn from their implementation and facilitate standardisation across the local health economy in Coventry and Warwickshire.  We set up a group of representatives from across the trust, which was led by the public health manager. Key stakeholders are outlined in Box 1.  The group met monthly and developed an action plan. Communication was vital, especially with staff and patients, and our neighbours who live and work near to the trust. This included local radio and newspaper coverage, delivering letters to local residents, briefing staff via a ward managers’ pack (including an example of the disciplinary process) and changing the wording of all patient leaflets and letters. We agreed a protocol across the trust for nicotine replacement therapy, and made stock available 24 hours a day for patients who wanted to manage without cigarettes during their stay and for those who wanted to quit.  Smokers who wanted to quit could access help from NHS Warwickshire Stop Smoking Service located in the ambulatory care unit at the hospital site or at a range of locations across Warwickshire.  All health professionals received brief intervention training, which takes a few minutes. The main messages are to:  Implementation went smoothly and we carried out a three-month evaluation. In the first few weeks we had a daily monitoring patrol, but this has now been reduced to weekly, in addition to security and staff reporting any breaches. So far we have had only one complaint from neighbours regarding staff congregating at the perimeters, and one member of staff received an informal warning for smoking offsite in uniform. The general feedback from smokers has been positive, with few adverse comments. Some staff are still reluctant to approach smokers on site because of the fear of violence and aggression, but by continuing to share the generally positive experiences of staff who have approached smokers we hope to dispel these anxieties.  Implementing a smoke-free policy can be daunting but collaboration, good communication and careful preparation are key to success. This includes the provision of education and training of staff and practical support for patients who smoke.	google

Altogether, 3.5 percent of all USA adults were e-cigarette users in 2015, down slightly from 3.7 percent in 2014, the CDC survey found. That is more than double the 13 percent youth cigarette-smoking rate in Montana. National studies report an increase in use of smokeless tobacco by high school athletes and found that athletes were nearly 80 percent more likely to use smokeless tobacco products than non-athletes. In the same time period, high school students using e-cigarettes within the past 30 days rose from 1.5 percent to 2.8 percent. E-cigarettes are now more popular with teenagers than traditional cigarettes. Researchers have also reported that teens who use e-cigarettes are more likely to switch to using regular cigarettes. In 2015, 24 percent of high school students were current users of e-cigarettes, compared to 11 percent who smoked cigarettes, a previous CDC survey found. This raises concern that there may be young people for whom e-cigarettes could be an entry point to use of conventional tobacco products, including cigarettes.  While some people will claim that e-cigarettes are better than traditional tobacco products, the fact is they are still a nicotine delivery system. Tobacco use and addiction mostly begin during adolescence. This would discourage smokers in North Dakota from using these products to quit, which seems to contradict the supposed reason for this huge tax increase.  "These data show a dramatic rise in usage of e-cigarettes by youth, and this is cause for great concern as we don't yet understand the long-term effects of these novel tobacco products", said Mitch Zeller, director of FDA's Center for Tobacco Products. They constitute population-level evidence. FDA is required to use a population health standard. However, there are proven cessation strategies and treatments, including counseling and FDA-approved cessation medications.

51	e1daec3c-d642-3d45-aff8-46c9005641b5	Navigating Cancer 2/21/2017: E-cigarettes may be a safer alternative	If you have watched television lately, you have seen the campaign directed at eliminating smoking altogether. In an attempt to stop smoking, many people turn to e-  cigarettes in an attempt to quit, or at least as an alternative to cigarettes with a feeling that the e-cigarette will be safer.  As the use of e-cigarettes continues to rise, concerns about their long-term effects on health have persisted. But now, a new study finds that smokers who switch to e-cigarettes only, much like those who switch to nicotine replacement therapy only, have fewer carcinogens and toxins in their bodies after six months, than those who continue to smoke cigarettes. This is important because it adds to the growing evidence that e-  cigarettes are a much safer alternative to smoking conventional tobacco cigarettes. This study, funded by the Cancer Research UK was recently published in the Annals of Internal Medicine.  The impact and cost of cigarettes is enormous. According to the World Health Organization, tobacco use kills around 5 million people per year, and more than 600,000 non-smokers who are exposed to second-hand smoke. Yes, 600,000 non-smokers.  Why is tobacco smoke so dangerous? At least 250 of the 4,000 chemicals in tobacco smoke are known to be harmful, including 50 that are known to cause cancer.  Electronic cigarettes are battery-operated devices that deliver nicotine that can be flavored, as well as other chemicals through vapor instead of smoke. In the United States, there are more than 250 brands of e-cigarettes on the market. Some look like traditional combustible cigarettes, cigars or pipes that deliver nicotine by burning tobacco, while others look like everyday items such as USB memory sticks and even your basic ink pens. While e-cigarettes are often promoted as safer alternatives to traditional, combustible cigarettes, the authors of the new study note that there has not been much research on the long-term health effects of the electronic cigarettes.  In some previous reports, research has suggested that e-cigarettes cause as much harm as combustible cigarettes, but the study authors note that they are based on research that does not reflect real-world exposure of e-cigarette users. The new study is the first of its kind because it analyzes intake of potentially harmful chemicals. Previous studies have measured potential toxicity of e-cigarettes by analyzing chemicals in the products and the vapor they produce.  In this study, researchers looked at saliva and urine samples, and measured the intake of potentially harmful chemicals in various groups of people, including former smokers who used e-cigarettes only for six months, former smokers who used licensed nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) only for six months, and smokers who continued to smoke regular cigarettes.  The results showed that while their levels of nicotine remained much the same, former smokers who had used e-cigarettes only or NRT only for six months had significantly lower levels of toxic chemicals and carcinogens in their bodies than the people who continued to smoke combustible cigarettes. However, participants who used e-cigarettes or NRT while continuing to smoke regular cigarettes did not show the same large reduction, suggesting that there must be a complete switch from traditional cigarettes to an e-cigarette to see a significant reduction in exposure to toxins.  In this study, researchers have shown that the levels of toxic chemicals in the body from e-cigarettes are considerably lower than suggested in previous studies using simulated experiments. This means some doubts about the safety of e-cigarettes may be wrong. The bottom line is that e-cigarettes appear to be much safer than traditional cigarettes. In course, the best approach is to stop smoking any type of products, traditional cigarettes and e-cigarettes, but at least this data suggest that e-cigarettes may be a useful long-term aid to smoking cessation for people who struggle to quit using other methods; however, the health benefits will only occur if users stop smoking traditional cigarettes altogether.

Inmates will not be able to buy or use tobacco in the jails from January, while those in open prisons will be barred from lighting up indoors from next month.  The Ministry of Justice announced the ban as the first stage of a national roll-out, and issued the findings of a scientific report showing prison officers were being exposed to “significant” amounts of second-hand smoke while on duty.  Andrew Selous, the prisons minister, said: “We have no plans to move to smoke free prisons overnight and will only do so in a phased way that takes into account operational resilience and readiness of each prison.  “The operational safety and security of our prisons will always be our top priority.”  Prisoners will be given access to e-cigarettes and products to help them give up the habit.  Mark Leech, editor of the Prisons Handbook, said: “We could have a very difficult time ahead of us – prisons are full of people with mental illness, who suffer from impulsive behaviour and who can be violent.  “I fear there will be unrest over this. There is also always the prospect of legal challenges.”  An independent report commissioned by the Ministry of Justice found prison officers spent on average one hour in six per shift exposed to secondary smoke above guidance levels.  The officers’ exposure to smoke was “at times significant” – for example, in Cardiff prison staff were exposed to levels of secondary smoke for more than three quarters of their shift.  Electronic measuring showed one officer was exposed to 1,027 micrograms of particulates per cubic metre, compared with a World Health Organisation recommended limit of 25 micrograms.  Sean Humber, a prison lawyer representing non-smoking prisoners concerned at their exposure to tobacco smoke, said: “In light of these monitoring results, which indicate that prison staff and non-smokers are currently being exposed to potentially unhealthy levels of cigarette smoke, it seems likely that the remaining prisons in England will need to go smoke free soon after these first four.”  • What is Stoptober and why is it popular?  All four Welsh prisons will go smoke-free from January along with jails at Exeter, Channings Wood and Dartmoor, all in Devon, and Erlestoke, in Wiltshire.	bing	Prisoners are to be banned from smoking in eight prisons across England and Wales amid warnings the move could lead to unrest behind bars and legal challenges

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has teamed up with five national physician groups to create the "Talk With Your Doctor" campaign. As its name implies, the campaign was established to encourage smokers to ask a doctor for help in quitting. The campaign also calls on doctors to ask their patients if they need help to stop smoking.  "Taking just a few minutes to talk to your patients about smoking can double the odds of them successfully quitting," said Surgeon General Dr. Regina Benjamin in a CDC news release. "As a physician, I know that clinicians and their staff can play an incredibly important role in helping smokers move from thinking about quitting to taking real steps toward successful quitting."  The "Talk With Your Doctor" campaign will combine with the existing "Tips From Former Smokers'' campaign from May 27 through June 2. Ads will appear on national television and online.  "Smokers have told us that hard-hitting, emotionally powerful ads like these provide the motivation they need, and the response to the ads supports that," CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden said in the news release. "We believe 'Talk With Your Doctor' will amplify and expand the great success of 'Tips' and offer more encouragement for smokers to quit for good. We hope doctors will offer evidence based counseling and medications to all patients who can benefit from them."  As part of this effort, doctors will also be offered educational materials and training on tobacco interventions.  The new campaign involves the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Physicians and the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.  "I've been a practicing physician who's helped patients quit, and treated some of the terrible diseases in those who didn't quit in time," Dr. Tim McAfee, director of the CDC's Office on Smoking and Health, said in the release. "The message of the 'Tips' campaign and our new 'Talk With Your Doctor' campaign is simple: Quit smoking now. Or better yet, don't start. Studies show that the sooner you quit the better. And there is nothing you can do to add more years to your life than to quit smoking."  Cigarette smoking kills an estimated 440,000 Americans each year, and 43 million Americans are current smokers.  The American Cancer Society provides a guide to quitting smoking.	bing

Higgins Abstract Introduction: Cigarette preference increases as a function of nicotine content, but preference can be shifted by manipulating cigarette cost. The aim of the present study is to model whether the behavioral-economic metric of unit price (cigarette cost/nicotine content) accounts for cigarette preference shifts and whether preference changes to very low nicotine content cigarettes (VLNCs) are associated with corresponding changes in smoking rate. Methods: 169 daily smokers from populations vulnerable to smoking completed sessions in which choices between smoking normal nicotine content (NNC) (15.8mg/g) and VLNC (0.4mg/g) cigarettes were concurrently available. In Condition 1, choices for both products were available ad-lib at an equal cost of 10 responses/choice. In Condition 2, VLNCs were again available ad-lib at 10 responses/choice, but NNCs were available on a progressive-ratio (PR) schedule wherein response cost (and unit price) increased following each NNC choice (10,160,320…8400 responses/choice). Results were analyzed using ANOVAs and a binomial test (p Results: Participants preferred NNCs over VLNCs in Condition 1, but shifted preference to VLNCs in Condition 2 (p Conclusions: These results suggest that unit price of nicotine underpins cigarette preference and may provide a metric by which regulators can predict product preference and potentially impact it through policy. These results also demonstrate that VLNCs sustain lower smoking rates than NNCs even under acute laboratory conditions. Language en Number of Pages 74 p.

Altria Group (MO) is no exception to this. The Altria group of companies has a strong American heritage stretching back more than 180 years.​ Philip Morris USA is the leading cigarette manufacturer in the United States and has been for more than 30 years.​ The U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company is the world’s leading producer and marketer of moist smokeless tobacco products.​  Currently the tobacco companies are facing headwinds, but the good pricing power of MO gets it through. Cost curtailment and price rises have contributed to its first quarter success.  Smokable Products: Net revenues in this segment were $3.7 billion. This segment benefitted from price increases and contributed to the first quarter success. Operating company income was $1.7 billion.  Smokeless Products: Net revenues in this segment were $398 million. Operating company income was $398 million.  Wine: Net revenues from this segment were $134 million. Operating company income was $27 million.  Altria bought back around $192 million value of shares in the first quarter. In the first quarter, it repurchased approximately 3.6 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $53.03.  The company expects the following:  EPS would be in the range of $2.75- $2.80.  A Look at the Dividends  Presently, Altria has a high dividend payout ratio of 80% of adjusted EPS. The present annualized dividend rate is $2.08 per common share. Altria paid approximately $1.0 billion in dividends in the first quarter.  Altria has increased its dividend 48 times in 46 years, and has increased its profitability primarily by its tobacco operating companies focusing on four strong premium brands, Marlboro, Copenhagen, Skoal and Black & Mild.  All That is Expected  The maker of Marlboro cigarettes is continually ramping up its innovation process. It is taking the right initiatives to gain market dominance. This trend is going to continue. MO is all set to build a solid international presence, and it may be rightly said that it will find many tobacco huffers. Investors who have no issues with these companies should definitely consider taking up this company for consideration. It has been known for pumping steady returns to its shareholders. MO is poised to grow further in the near future, creating shareholder returns. Turning to innovative tobacco products, Nu Mark remains focused on building a robust portfolio of innovative tobacco products for adult smokers and vapors.  Altria is a dividend aristocrat despite hailing from an unhealthy industry, this company has a huge customer base. This company is known for becoming investors’ staple. It competes with premium brands and boasts of higher margins than most of them. Many have thought that the cigarette industry is a sunset industry because of the social stigmatization attached to it. But there is a silver lining to it since an increasing number of people are moving towards ecigarettes. Out of the global $169 billion tobacco industry, about $6 billion comes from ecigs. The U.S. is the largest e-cig market worth $1.7 billion as of 2014. This company has plenty of room for growth and to offer to its shareholders.  In the smokable segment, PM USA’s steady investments in Marlboro continued to strengthen the brand’s leadership position. In the smokeless segment, USSTC grew its volume, supported by retail share gains from Copenhagen and Skoal combined.  There is a decline in smoking rates, and the regulations are increasing. It is safer to invest in this company since people prefer the same brands over and over again. It has a steady balance sheet. The diversion into the ecigarettes will certainly add fuel to its growth. MO derives most of its profits from its ecigs. So we can rightly assume that a hefty amount of its revenues would be added by ecigs.  It is one of the most consistent companies and has increased its dividends y-o-y. For the past 46 years, it has increased its dividends. It had a remarkable quarter and I am bullish about this company.	google

That’s more than the total number of deaths from car accidents, suicide, murder, fires, AIDS and accidental poisonings combined”. It has been shown that smoking increases your chance of heart disease, lung disease and many different types of cancer. It also damages your eyes, oral health, immune system and can lead to osteoporosis. Even though the dangers of smoking are well documented, many people are still caught in the habit. Why? It is a powerful addiction.  Cigarettes are mostly made from the tobacco plant, which contains highly addictive nicotine. Once a cigarette is lit, it contains over 4000 chemicals which mix together to form tar. This is why smoking, at any level, is dangerous for the health of all those exposed. The trouble is that cigarettes are not only physically addictive, they are also psychologically addictive, as associations are made between smoking and daily activities.  While the act of quitting is incredibly difficult, the health benefits are substantial. The Canadian Lung Association reports that within one year of quitting smoking your risk of dying from a heart attack drops by half. Naturopathic Doctor, Sara Celik gives a few additional facts. “Within 72 hours, your entire body will test 100% nicotine-free and over 90% of all nicotine metabolites (the chemicals it breaks down into) will now have passed via urine. Within 21 days, you may notice a stronger immune system, elevated energy levels, and a calm, relaxed body.”  TIPS TO STOP SMOKING!  LIST IT – Write down the reasons you want to quit smoking on a card and place it where you normally keep your cigarettes. Review the list during times of temptation, then wait and re-read until the urge has passed.  MAKE A STATEMENT - Set a specific day to quit, tell at least 10 friends that you are going to quit smoking for accountability, and then DO IT!  CLEAN HOUSE - Throw away all cigarettes, butts, matches, and ash trays.  USE SUBSTITUTES - Instead of smoking, chew on raw vegetables and fruit to avoid weight gain, not candy! If your fingers seem empty, play with a pencil.  BABY STEPS – Don’t focus on the next week, month or year. Take the process one day at a time. Try to replace overwhelming negative thoughts such as “I can’t do it, it’s too hard” with positive, optimistic messages.  EAT WELL – Clean up your diet and drink plenty of fresh fruit & vegetable juice during the first three days after you quit, to help flush nicotine out of your system.  VISUALIZE – Imagine yourself as a non-smoker without the side effects of nicotine and the satisfaction that comes from being in control of your life.  FIND FRIENDS – You are not alone! Realize that 40 million Americans have quit. If they can do it, so can you! Join a support group. It appears that doing so can increase success rates.  STRESS LESS- When you need to relax, try stretch management techniques, such as deep breathing exercises rather than reaching for a cigarette.  BE PREPARED – Journal your triggers, feelings and accomplishments. Avoid situations that you associate with smoking (i.e. drinking alcohol) and set up a plan to be prepared when faced with temptation.  GOLD STARS - Each day, reward yourself in a positive way by celebrating your accomplishments! Buy yourself something with the money you’ve saved or plan a special reward as a celebration for quitting.  ADDITIONAL HELP – Consider a 30-day supplement program to help expel mucus, repair the respiratory system, reduce cravings and help curb the effects of nicotine addiction in the brain. Celik explains that Naturopathic Doctors support the use of specific herbs, vitamins and amino acids to help make quitting easier!  Lung Support: Your lungs bring fresh oxygen into your body and remove carbon dioxide and other waste gases that your body doesn’t need. Optimal lung function is vital for your body to receive the oxygen it needs to power your bodies every process. If the respiratory tract is not in good health, it can become sluggish and result in congestion and/or poor functioning. Look for herbs to help expel mucous from the respiratory system, as well as soothe inflamed tissue and bronchial passages. Examples include mullein, thyme and fenugreek. In addition, consider antioxidants (such as N-acetyl-L-Cysteine, Vitamin C) that help to protect the respiratory system, allowing it to repair and rebuild faster.  Craving Reduction: Look for ingredients such as green tea extract, GABA and L-Tyrosine which work to help curb the effects of nicotine addiction in the brain.  Stress Management: Look for ingredients that help promote restfulness and relaxation as smokers often report anxiety and insomnia as problems associated with attempts in quitting. Examples include hops, skullcap, lemon balm and 5-HTP.

Massachusetts OKs ban on flavored vaping, tobacco products FILE - In this Friday, Oct. 4, 2019 file photo, a woman using an electronic cigarette exhales a puff of smoke in Mayfield Heights, Ohio. Massachusetts lawmakers have approved the nation's toughest restrictions on flavored tobacco and vaping products, including menthol cigarettes. The ban was passed by the Senate early Thursday, Nov. 21, before the legislature broke for a holiday recess. It had earlier been passed by the state House of Representatives. BOSTON (AP) — Massachusetts lawmakers passed a groundbreaking ban Thursday on the sale of flavored tobacco and vaping products, including menthol cigarettes. The bill would also place a 75% excise tax on vaping products and require health insurers, including the state’s Medicaid program, to cover tobacco cessation counseling. “This nation-leading step will save lives,” Democratic House Speaker Robert DeLeo said. The ban was passed by the Senate early Thursday before the legislature broke for a holiday recess. It had earlier been passed by the state House of Representatives and now goes to the desk of Republican Gov. Charlie Baker. Baker hasn’t indicated whether or when he will sign the ban, but its chances are good. In September, he had declared a public health emergency and ordered a temporary ban on the sale of vaping products. The legislation would immediately ban the sale of flavored vaping products and would outlaw sales of menthol cigarettes starting June 1, 2020. The legislation responds to growing concern about the health effects of vaping products, including deaths. It is the first such statewide legislation in the country, according to Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids. “This legislation is a critical step to help end the worsening youth e-cigarette epidemic and stop tobacco companies from using appealing flavors to lure kids into a lifetime of addiction,” he said in a written statement. “It would make Massachusetts the first state in the nation to prohibit the sale of all flavored tobacco products.” The American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network also called it first-in-the-nation legislation. “More than 80% of teens who have ever used a tobacco product started with a flavored product, and the tobacco industry knows this,” the organization said in an emailed statement. Studies have shown menthol cigarettes are consumed disproportionately by young people and minorities, and anti-tobacco groups and health experts have argued menthol has been marketed in particular to African Americans. A major retailers’ organization called the legislation disappointing. “We are disappointed the legislature supports bills that disproportionately impact communities of color and have disastrous implications for public health, public safety, state tax revenue and jobs in the Commonwealth,” Jonathan Shaer, president of the New England Convenience Store Owners and Energy Marketers Association said in a statement. He called menthol and mint tobacco as “legal, adult products that aren’t associated with youth overuse.” Copyright 2019 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

That has been corrected to two months.  Georgia Southern University is set to become a tobacco-free campus effective August 1 and changes are already in place to transition campus into a tobacco-free zone, starting with the removal of ash urns.  In a letter from Brooks Keel, president of GSU, he explains that this decision is based on a recommendation from the Georgia Southern Tobacco-Free committee and approval from the President’s Cabinet.  The original date of the ban was set for October 1, a date handed down from the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia this past March when the board voted on the tobacco ban policy.  Beginning two months ahead of the enforcement date, the tobacco ban prohibits all and any use of tobacco products anywhere on land leased or owned GSU, including public spaces, cars and buildings.  “We all know that change is not always easy, but this University System of Georgia policy change reinforces our commitment to preserving and improving the health and comfort of our students, faculty, staff and guests,” Keel said in his letter.  Keel called tobacco and non-tobacco users to share the responsibility of this ban together and listed resources for students and faculty who are tobacco users, such as tobacco cessation classes and links to American Cancer Society and Georgia Department of Community Health.	google	Georgia Southern University is set to become a tobacco-free campus effective August 1

Rappler comes from the root words "rap" (to discuss) + "ripple" (to make waves). SIN TAX. Lawmakers wants to increase the taxes imposed on tobacco and alcoholic drinks MANILA, Philippines – President Rodrigo Duterte agreed to certify as urgent the bill of Senator Manny Pacquiao increasing tobacco tax to P60 per pack, from the current P30. Duterte approved the recommendation of the Department of Health (DOH) and the Department of Finance (DOF) to back Pacquiao's bill, which he filed in October 2017. Senate Bill Number 1599, seeking to amend Republic Act 10351 or the Sin Tax Reform Act of 2012, increases the current unitary excise tax rate to P60 per pack from P30 per pack, and the annual excise tax to 9% from 4%. "The recommendation of the Department of Finance and the Department of Health is that this bill should be certified as urgent because, under the proposal, the tax on tobacco would be raised to P60 per pack, while on the part of alcohol it will be P40 per liter, so the recommendation is that that bill should be passed and signed into law," said Presidential Spokesman Salvador Panelo on Tuesday, January 8. On Monday night, Duterte presided over the first Cabinet meeting of 2019, during which he approved the DOH and DOF recommendation on Pacquiao's bill. But back in October 2018, Health Secretary Francisco Duque, in a letter to Duterte, had backed another Senate version of the bill, Senate Bill Number 1605, which seeks to impose a tax of P90 per pack, not P60 per pack. "This is a key public health measure to reduce deaths and disabilities due to tobacco and alcohol consumption, and, at the same time, a revenue measure to fund the universal health care program," Panelo said in a statement. Pacquiao, after filing his bill, had said that the higher tobacco and alcohol tax could generate some P60 billion to P70 billion in revenue for the government. The DOH previously said about P257 billion was needed for the first year of the universal health care program's implementation. The Senate and House were able to reconcile their versions of the universal health care (UHC) bill last November. Duterte has yet to sign it into law. The UHC bill seeks to automatically enroll all Filipinos in the proposed National Health Insurance Program. Meanwhile, bills for raising tobacco and alcohol taxes have been pending in the Senate since November 2017. In contrast, the House of Representatives passed its versions of a bill jacking up cigarette tax and a separate bill increasing tax on alcohol in December 2018. Whatever bill for higher tobacco and alcohol taxes will be passed into law will add to existing taxes imposed by the first tax reform package or the Train Law. – Rappler.com Would you like to share your vote?

Â The annual Stoptober campaign in England is embracing the vaping form of smoking. Â This is seen as being the key to getting people to quit.  Until now health experts have tended to shy away from explicitly promoting e-cigarettes.  But the government campaign during October features vaping in its TV ad.  The guidance comes after e-cigarettes proved the most popular tool for quitting and done during last year’s campaign.  Some 53% of people used them. The e-cigarette helped push the numbers taking part in Stoptober since launch in 2012 to over 1.5 million.  E-cigarettes not yet officially prescribed on the NHS.  Vaping  However, doctors and other health professionals are encouraged to advise smokers vaping is a better alternative to smoking. That is if they want to use them.  New draft guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) does not list e-cigarettes. Â Not as a recommendation to help people quit. Â Although patients should be told that some smokers have found them helpful when they want to give up.  NICE advises that people who want to give up smoking need to know: Â there’s currently little evidence on the long-term benefits or harm of these products.  A successful attempt judged to be one where the person had tried to stop smoking in the past year and was still abstaining at the time of the survey.  The biggest rise in successful attempts to quit was among people from poorer backgrounds, who have traditionally been the least likely to give up.  Stats:  Latest figures suggest just over 15% of people were smoking in 2016. This down from 21% in 2007, when the smoking ban was introduced, and over 26% at the turn of the century.  As smoking has decreased, vaping has increased. About one in 20 people over 16 regularly uses e-cigarettes currently. A quarter of them are smokers or ex-smokers.

Smoking is a serious illness that affects the smoker and those around him. Smoking destroys the lungs and reduces the amount of oxygen in your body’s cells and causes many other bad health effects such as cancer, pneumonia and early death.  We need more education about how smoking is dangerous. Experts and cancer survivors should do meetings in school and use social media like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter to share information. Cancer survivors can be invited to schools to talk to children about how bad smoking is. Also, the government can do many more things to stop people from smoking. For example, tobacco can be taxed more.  If we all stand for not smoking and educate young people about the dangers of smoking, everyone’s health will improve. This is too important for society to ignore.	mention.com

Ombudsman Conchita Carpio Morales signed on April 16 Office Circular No. 12, requiring the strict compliance with the smoking ban.  The ban covers all forms of tobacco products, including cigarettes, electronic-cigarettes or e-cigars and similar devices.  Morales included vaping in the list of smoking-related offenses that could result in a hefty fine as well as criminal and administrative cases against officials and employees who will not heed the policy.  A directive prohibiting smoking within the premises of the anti-graft agency has been in place since 2010 but it was not strictly followed, according to Morales.  “To ensure the success of the anti-smoking policy, smokers and non-smokers alike should be educated on the negative effects of smoking necessitating a need for the implementation of a smoking cessation program,” Morales said.  “Smoking refers to the act of lighting and or puffing any lighted cigarette, cigar, or any other form of tobacco product,” the ombudsman’s circular read.  E-cigarettes were not popular at the time when former Ombudsman Merceditas Gutierrez banned smoking within the anti-graft agency’s premises six years ago.  Users of e-cigarettes argued that vaping is not smoking because the end product is not inhaled but the vapor created by the vaporizing liquid.  Morales said she decided to issue a new anti-smoking policy since the previous one had not been strictly observed by ombudsman officials and employees.  She said the smoking ban in all government offices is in compliance with the Clean Air Act of 1999 and Tobacco Regulation Act of 2003.  Violators face fines of up to P10,000, Morales said.  The Civil Service Commission is also implementing smoke-free policy in government offices.  Morales ordered building administrators and supervisors to post no smoking signs and remove ashtrays and other cigarette receptacles within the vicinity of the Office of the Ombudsman.	bing	MANILA, Philippines – The Office of the Ombudsman has issued a directive banning vaping and smoking within its premises

Vapers looking for that distinctive tobacco flavor will settle for nothing less when it comes to tobacco-flavor e-liquid though many other characters enter into the mix. The tobacco in cigarettes does not have different flavor profiles. But tobacco e-liquid can and does have several flavor notes. Mixers do their best to extract a tobacco plant’s natural, earthy flavors – all the characteristics that are lost to combustion. They are also careful not to add artificial flavors so as not to change that authentic tobacco flavor.

Credit BigStock The governing bodies of both Kansas City, Missouri, and Kansas City, Kansas, voted Thursday to raise the legal age for buying tobacco and electronic nicotine-vapor products from 18 to 21 in their communities. Advocates have said studies indicate that as many as 95 percent of adult smokers say they started smoking prior to age 21.  They also have pointed to studies showing that 18-year-old smokers often become the “connection” for younger members of their high school social network, some as young as 14. The legal age increase proposals sailed through the Kansas City, Missouri City Council and the Board of Commissioners of the Unified Government of Wyandotte County/Kansas City, Kansas with only one “nay” vote on each of the two governing bodies. Both the Missouri and Kansas ordinances take effect before Dec. 1 and include fines for sellers, but not for underage buyers. Kansas City, Missouri, also added nicotine-vapor products to the list banned in enclosed public spaces, including bars and restaurants.

73	3d453150-8ed6-3b79-bd6d-d33b819db488	Statement from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., on new steps the agency is taking to support the development of novel nicotine replacement drug therapies to help smokers quit cigarettes	Statement from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., on new steps the agency is taking to support the development of novel nicotine replacement drug therapies to help smokers quit cigarettes SILVER SPRING, Md., Aug. 3, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- As a public health agency, there is no greater impact we can have to improve the health of our nation than to significantly reduce the rate of tobacco-related disease and death. Through the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's comprehensive framework for regulating nicotine and tobacco, we're developing policies that support the possibility of a world where combustible cigarettes could no longer create or sustain addiction. A key part of this framework are steps to pave the way for products that help currently addicted smokers move away from the deadliest form of nicotine delivery. Part of this work requires that we recognize that nicotine, while highly addictive, is delivered through products posing a continuum of risk â with combustible cigarettes at one end, to nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) products at the other. We're working on multiple fronts to recognize the role that more novel forms of nicotine delivery could play in achieving our public health goals, as part of an appropriately regulated marketplace. This not only includes encouraging innovation of potentially less harmful tobacco products for those adults who still seek to use nicotine (such as e-cigarettes), but also taking a closer look at our overall approach to the development and regulation of NRT products that are regulated as drugs, and designed to safely reduce withdrawal symptoms, including nicotine craving, associated with quitting smoking. The development of novel NRT products, regulated as new drugs, is a critical part of our overall strategy on nicotine. We know that about 70 percent of adult smokers in the U.S. want to quit. In fact, nearly half try to quit each year. But few succeed. Use of FDA-approved NRT products is generally considered to double the likelihood of a successful quit attempt (with variations between products). Our ultimate goal is to help more smokers completely quit cigarettes. But most of the existing NRTs â such as gums, patches and lozenges â have been approved for more than 20 years. With novel forms of nicotine delivery being developed, it's possible that new kinds of NRTs â with different characteristics or routes of delivery â can offer additional opportunities for smokers to quit combustible tobacco. We want to explore what new steps we can take using our regulatory policies to enable opportunities for innovation, while making sure these products are demonstrated to be safe and effective for their intended use. To achieve these goals, the Nicotine Steering Committee that we established last September has been evaluating new, evidence-based opportunities to advance therapeutic nicotine products for combustible tobacco product cessation. We have been examining the types of safety and efficacy studies that we suggest be conducted and the way that these products are used and labeled. This work to re-evaluate and modernize our framework aims to provide clarity for companies seeking to avail themselves of the pathway to market safe and effective smoking cessation products.Â Today, and as a result of this work, we're releasing the first of two draft guidances aimed at supporting the development of novel, inhaled nicotine replacement therapies that could be submitted to the FDA for approval as new drugs, similar to current over-the-counter pharmaceutical NRT products. The guidance, "Nonclinical Testing of Orally Inhaled Nicotine-Containing Drug Products," focuses on data recommended to evaluate potential toxicities associated with orally inhaled nicotine-containing drug products. This includes products such as electronic nicotine delivery systems like e-cigarettes that are intended for smoking cessation and other long-term uses that would make them subject to regulation as drugs. This is draft guidance. We're interested in public comment. We want to strike the right balance between enabling a viable, efficient path for these products to be regulated as drugs â where we have substantial tools to evaluate their safety and efficacy for their intended use as smoking cessation products. At the same time, we want to make sure we're asking sufficient questions about the long-term health effects of these inhaled products, especially their effect on the lungs, to ensure that they are safe for their intended use. This information will help FDA advance this new guidance. This draft guidance, when finalized, is aimed at providing sponsors with recommendations on the nonclinical information appropriate to support development and approval of orally inhaled nicotine-containing drug products. It recognizes that a great deal of toxicity information is available for nicotine. But such information may not be available for other compounds contained in e-liquids and delivered by these products. These include the flavorings and heat-generated chemicals. These products can be used for six months or more over the course of a lifetime. So, it's important to understand the risks to humans from these exposures, including developmental and reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity. We anticipate releasing the second draft guidance this fall. This second guidance will help lay out a framework for new potential clinically relevant outcomes for smoking cessation products, such as reducing the chance of a smoker going back to using cigarettes long term and showing a positive impact on certain measures of cardiovascular health. That future guidance also is expected to address potential alternative treatment regimens like pre-treatment before quit day, quitting by gradual reduction (reduce-to-quit), or using two NRT drug products together. These guidances are one part of larger policy efforts to address the public health crisis of tobacco usage in this country. Given some of these products are relatively new technologies, or innovations that haven't yet been through the product development and evaluation process, we'll be seeking input on these draft guidances and welcome feedback on whether we've struck the right balance between innovation and safety; and set the right framework to encourage companies to use the new drug pathway to bring novel NRT products to market, with our public health mission leading the charge. This work is aimed at creating a more flexible framework that enables the development of safe and effective product innovations that have the potential to be helpful in assisting smokers quit combustible cigarettes and improve their health. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation's food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.	webhose.io

A Philip Morris Marlboro brand cigarette burns in an ashtray Credit: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg Philip Morris International, the maker of Marlboro cigarettes in overseas markets, is in talks to reunite with Altria Group more than 10 years after the tobacco giants split their operations. The deal would be the biggest since AT&T Inc. bid for Time Warner in 2016. Philip Morris had a market value of nearly $126.4 billion at the close of trading on Aug. 23, before speculation of a possible deal gained traction, while Altria was worth about $86.7 billion. The companies broke apart more than a decade ago, bowing to pressure from U.S. investors who wanted higher dividends and more share buybacks. The move was also pitched as a way to set free faster-growing overseas operations while the U.S. business was entangled in smoker lawsuits. But times have changed. Altria has recently diversified its portfolio with investments in vaping and cannabis, giving the company more growth potential even as fewer people smoke cigarettes. Some analysts and investors have argued that the companies should get back together, a move that would give Philip Morris more U.S. exposure. The transaction would give Philip Morris roughly 58% ownership of the new company, with Altria holding the rest, according to a person familiar with the terms who asked not to be identified because the details haven’t been made public. They are considering a no-premium deal based on the companies’ closing share prices on Aug. 23, according to the person. The companies would aim to close the deal within six months and expect to make no divestitures, the person said. Alternate products There’s been speculation that the companies might get back together. On Monday, Wells Fargo published a research note that said a deal could make sense now, in part because Altria has a stake in the vaping company Juul. A reunification would combine two of the most popular smoking alternative products: IQOS and Juul. Philip Morris has been plowing billions of dollars in promoting IQOS, a heat-not-burn product used by millions consumers outside the U.S.. Altria meanwhile has invested $12.8 billion in e-cigarette upstart Juul Labs Inc., which has catapulted itself to the U.S. industry leader in smoking alternatives in just a few years. Altria also has been planning to start selling IQOS in the U.S. this year, testing out demand in the Atlanta area with a store opening next month. Philip Morris said in a statement that no agreement has been formally reached and any deal would be subject to board, shareholder and regulatory approval. Altria also issued a statement confirming the talks. Like Hollywood, which has been churning out films based on blockbusters of decades past, Wall Street bankers seem to be running out of new ideas. Earlier this month, CBS Corp. agreed to reunite with Viacom Inc. in an $11.7 billion transaction, 13 years after the two media giants split. Analysts were largely positive on a potential tie-up between Altria and Philip Morris after speculation Monday afternoon that something was brewing. RBC Capital Markets analyst Nik Modi saw several strategic reasons for a deal, including geographic alignment with international competitors and full economic benefit of IQOS in the U.S. and global access for Juul. “The potential to reunite the companies has been often discussed, but we did not believe this would occur given the heavy regulatory burden in the U.S. market and its weakening growth profile,” Stifel analyst Chris Growe said in a note. “Perhaps the FDA’s approval of IQOS changed that thinking.” Antitrust concerns The tie-up would face little antitrust risk because the companies’ brands don’t compete in the same markets, said Kenneth Shea, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. That contrasts with the last major tobacco deal: Reynolds American Inc.’s 2015 takeover of Lorillard. The Federal Trade Commission, which reviews tobacco deals, required Reynolds to sell four brands to Imperial Tobacco Group to resolves antitrust concerns. One area of likely scrutiny would be the combined company’s control of the vaping market, said Shea, given Altria’s 35% stake in Juul and its agreement to sell IQOS in the U.S. for Philip Morris. “Depending on how regulators define the vapor market, there could be potential for perceived excessive control,” he said.	rss

TIPS is expected to be operational in 2019/20. The electronic payment system has enhanced regulatory capabilities by providing transparency and enabling the bank to better perform its oversight responsibilities while ensuring the system safety. During the period, four new payment system licenses were issued to commercial banks, making 43 licenses. The number of non-bank institutions licensed to provide payment system reached 15 at the end of June 2019 from 13 at the end of June 2018. In terms of payments instruments and products, the use of Quick Response (QR) code technology for merchant payments boosted usage of mobile money in the market. According to BoT, two participants were registered and added to TISS namely China Dasheng Bank and Yetu Microfinance Bank, making the number of participants to 52.	web

Keeping the windows open in the car or house doesn’t eliminate the risk, either.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that secondhand smoke exposure causes more than 41,000 deaths from heart disease and lung cancer among non-smoking adults each year. Secondhand smoke contains more than 7,000 chemicals, including 70 that have been linked to cancer.  Young children are most affected by secondhand smoke. This is especially true for children that live in a household where one or both parents smoke cigarettes at home. Common symptoms seen in children who are exposed to secondhand smoke include ear infections, severe asthma attacks and respiratory problems.  Keep in mind that there’s no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke. The best way to protect yourself is to not allow smoking in your home, car or anywhere you and your family live, work and play. Talk with friends and family members who are thinking about quitting. Your support can make the difference in their attempts to quit.	mention.com									secondhand smoke exposure causes more than 41,000 deaths from heart disease and lung cancer among non-smoking adults each year.

How’d that work out? Nonetheless, officials have repeatedly tried to control the citizens’ urges over the years, ignoring the lessons of history as they go. And there you’d have it -- problem solved, right? No more smokers. No more of the terrible health consequences of cigarette smoking. Yeah, right -- that would happen. Because making it impossible for folks who are addicted to nicotine -- or who simply enjoy the effects of the highly addictive drug -- aren’t going to be magically free from desiring their fix if the federal government has made it impossible to get it from legal, over-the-counter cigarettes. They’ll look elsewhere, perhaps even to more dangerous alternatives. Black market smokes. Nicotine-laced products made in fly-by-night facilities shy on safety regulations. Street corner nicotine dealers promising the real thing. The goal is understandable enough. In a perfect world, there’d be no one smoking cigarettes. The negative health consequences are so great -- smoking is linked to 480,000 preventable deaths annually -- that no one can defend smoking as a logical pursuit. But effectively barring it by diminishing the drug that smokers are administering to themselves with each drag will cause problems that are easily anticipated. News of the plan was widely reported by various media outlets on Monday as something that was under consideration by President Joe Biden’s administration. There was no official announcement, no response to queries from reporters who asked questions of the White House. It’s enough to make one think that the Biden administration got the news out intentionally to see how it would be perceived. In politics, this is called a “trial balloon.” Send it up, with no one’s name attached to it, and see if it can fly. This one should go nowhere. Except, perhaps, in the schemes of those who would like to see a thriving market of real, full-nicotine cigarettes that are legal in other nations being smuggled into the United States.

The Indiana House introduced the tax hike as part of the budget process.  That hasn’t sat well with the Indiana Grocery and Convenience Store Association, which called the potential increase “devastating” to its members. Raising the Indiana cigarette tax a dollar would put the state on par with neighbors Michigan and Illinois, but 40 cents higher than Ohio.  Retailers predict a tax increase would hit them hard. Chuck Taylor of the Chuckles Convenience Store chain said his stores experienced an 18% decline in sales when the state jacked up cigarette taxes a decade ago. Circle K estimates it would lose $3 million annually in the wake of a higher tax. Gary Kuns, tobacco marketing director for Speedway, testified that Illinois generated less tax money when that state increased the cigarette tax by a dollar five years ago.  Health advocates are pushing hard for a higher cigarette tax as a way to curb smoking. In 2015, Indiana had a 20.6% smoking rate, ranking it as the 12th highest of all 50 states.	mention.com	​INDIANAPOLIS – Indiana convenience stores are fighting a proposed $1 per pack tax increase on cigarettes									
82	ef9345ec-920b-37f4-b576-fd19bd8fb5b5	Quitting smoking is hard. FDA wants new nicotine-replacement therapies to help.	Wednesday Nov 29, 2017 at 4:00 PM Laurie Mcginley - The Washington Post The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday it is taking new steps to encourage the development of innovative nicotine-replacement therapies to wean smokers off conventional cigarettes. In a blog post on the agency's website, three top officials said they want to ensure the FDA has the right policies to advance new products to help smokers. "Our goal is to enable greater use of safe and effective options to help those who are addicted to nicotine get the help they need to quit combustible cigarettes altogether," said the post, which was signed by FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research Director Janet Woodcock and Center for Tobacco Products Director Mitchell Zeller. The post said a new Nicotine Steering Committee made up of senior FDA officials will explore the agency's handling of smoking-cessation products. It said the agency will hold a hearing on Jan. 26 to get public input. Among the questions the committee will explore: Are there ways to improve on the current over-the-counter nicotine-replacement systems, or new strategies that might be more effective? And how should they be evaluated? The effort is part of the agency's new tobacco-regulatory regime announced by Gottlieb last summer. About 480,000 people die of tobacco-related causes in the United States every year. While nicotine hooks people, it doesn't kill them; the hazard is posed by thousands of other chemical substances in cigarettes, many of them carcinogenic. Current FDA nicotine-replacement therapies include over-the counter gums, patches and lozenges, and prescription nasal sprays and inhalers. Most of those have been on the market for more than two decades. The blog post points out that studies suggest using such products can double the chance of success among those trying to quit smoking. The therapies are designed to supply controlled amounts of nicotine to reduce cravings. The committee will consider which types of safety and efficacy studies should be required for nicotine-replacement therapies as well as other issues. Those could include "changes to the labeling and indications for existing products or a new product that might deliver nicotine at different rates, or through different delivery mechanisms," the post said. For example, some e-cigarettes or other types of electronic nicotine delivery systems might be candidates for regulation as over-the-counter nicotine-replacement therapies. But the FDA officials said they also see "additional opportunities" for new and improved OTC products that could help smokers quit. In July, Gottlieb unveiled a new framework for tobacco that was designed to put nicotine at the center of the agency's regulatory effort. As part of the plan, he said, the FDA would require reductions in nicotine in conventional cigarettes to make them minimally addictive or nonaddictive. He stressed at the time that people who are addicted to nicotine would need alternative ways to get the drug if they are to successfully give up regular cigarettes. To make sure e-cigarettes are readily accessible, he delayed for several years a requirement that e-cigarettes marketed after February 2007 submit to a stringent FDA review. About 70 percent of adult smokers in the United States say they want to quit, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and more than half try to do so each year.	rss										
83	24de1062-745c-3c44-aa76-99ed92f98e58	Campaign to raise California cigarette tax gets signatures to make ballot	A well-financed campaign backed by billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer, medical groups and organized labor said Monday that it collected more than 1 million signatures for a ballot measure to raise California's cigarette tax by $2 a pack.Steyer and other leaders of the Save Lives California coalition delivered boxes of petitions to the San Diego County of Registrar of Voters office and will do the same at county offices throughout the state in coming days in its bid to raise the tax to $2.87 a pack.If 585,407 signatures are verified, the proposed state constitutional amendment would appear on an increasingly crowded Nov. 8 ballot alongside proposals to overturn a ban on single-use plastic bags at grocery stores and require actors to use condoms in adult films.The announcement came less than a month after Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown signed legislation to make California the second state in the nation, following Hawaii, to raise the legal age to buy tobacco from 18 to 21. Beginning June 9, it will be a crime to sell or give tobacco to anyone under 21 - except military personnel.The tax increase would apply to electronic cigarettes and other products with tobacco or nicotine. The measure calls for proceeds to be spent on Medi-Cal - the state's version of Medicaid - along with anti-smoking campaigns and medical research.Steyer, a former hedge fund manager who has contributed $1 million, said at a news conference that the campaign is personal because his mother had a three-pack-a-day habit and died of lung cancer 14 years ago."I think everybody in California has a family member, a close friend, whose lives have been tragically affected by tobacco ... This is going to make smokers pay their fair share," he said.The increase would make California's cigarette tax the ninth-highest in the nation, according to the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, an advocacy group. New York has the nation's highest state tax at $4.35 a pack, and Virginia is lowest at 30 cents.The weighted average cost for pack of cigarettes is $5.96 nationwide. The highest combined state-local tax rate is $6.16 in Chicago, with New York City second at $5.85 per pack.The average per-pack cost in California, which prohibits local cigarette taxes, is about $5.50, said Debra Kelley, advocacy director of the American Lung Association. The $2-a-pack increase would raise that to about $7.50 if cigarette makers pass along the full amount to consumers.David Sutton, a spokesman for tobacco company Altria Group Inc., said it opposes large targeted tobacco and e-vapor taxes. Altria is reviewing the California initiative and considering its options, he said.The American Vaping Association said it would work to defeat the measure but was undecided how much it would spend."Public health benefits every time a smoker switches to vaping," said George Conley, the group's president. "By recklessly campaigning to equate the taxes on deadly cigarettes with smoke-free vapor products, it is clearer than ever that so called 'anti-smoking' activists have officially gone off the rails."Backers of the tax increase contend that vaping lures young people to smoking tobacco.The tobacco tax campaign reported this month that it spent $2.8 million during the first three months of the year and had more than $4 million in cash on hand. Major backers include the California Medical Association, California Association of Hospitals and Health Systems, and the Service Employees International Union.Seven measures have collected enough signatures to qualify for the November ballot in the state, and an eighth - placed by the Legislature - would repeal prohibitions on multilingual instruction in public schools.The tobacco tax joins four other measures, including a proposal to legalize recreational use of marijuana, that are pending signature verification.	google	medical groups and organized labor said Monday that it collected more than 1 million signatures for a ballot measure to raise California's cigarette tax by $2 a pack					Beginning June 9, it will be a crime to sell or give tobacco to anyone under 21 - except military personnel.

85	e9767c75-dd51-3f6c-a2c4-d2aedaf1f438	World No Tobacco Day: FDA sustains anti-tobacco education in schools, public places	The Food and Drugs Authority (FDA), as part of this year’s World No-Tobacco Day-2021 (WNTD) celebration, is intensifying its anti-tobacco smoking public education campaign in schools, marketplaces and transport terminals. The education aims to sensitise the public on the need to quit smoking and the associated health benefits of not smoking. The year-long campaign, under the theme, ‘Commit to quit’, according to the FDA, would advocate for strong tobacco cessation policies, promote increased access to cessation services, raise awareness of tobacco industry tactics and empower tobacco users to make successful attempts to quit smoking through ‘quit and win initiatives’. Though more than 804,000 adults in Ghana are estimated to smoke cigarettes and other tobacco products on a daily basis, the Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS, 2017) has estimated that the incident is prevalent among young people in the country. The GYTS Ghana Fact Sheet indicates that 8.8 percent of boys and 8.1 per cent of girls, currently use tobacco products whiles the use of shisha is sharply rising among young people in Ghana. Every year, tobacco kills more than eight million people globally, with almost seven million of these deaths emanating directly from tobacco use, with around 1.2 million people dying due to exposure to second-hand smoke from smokers. Smokers are exposed to a lethal mixture of more than 7000 toxic chemicals including at least 70 known carcinogens that can damage nearly every organ in the human body. Instructively, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that smoking causes over $500 billion in economic damage each year. The Head of Tobacco and Substances of Abuse Department of the FDA, Dr Mrs Olivia Boateng speaking on the need for smokers to quit, said the COVID-19 pandemic has even presented a higher risk to smokers as the hand to mouth contact during smoking and sharing of mouth pieces of shisha tubes could easily aid the spread of the virus. Dr Boateng explained that a review of studies by public health experts convened by WHO on April 29, 2020 confirmed the higher risk of smokers to COVID-19 complications alongside other respiratory diseases. The complications are a result of the compromised lung function arising from continuous exposure to tobacco toxins. Giving details of data on smokers, she said the 804,000 daily cigarette smokers figure, was estimated by the Tobacco Atlas Ghana (2015) and that it included more than 425,200 men, 69,200 women and 2,700 boys. About 75 men in Ghana die every week from cigarettes smoking. To this end, the FDA seeks to promote the benefits of quitting tobacco. These benefits are enormous and kick in almost immediately. For instance, 20 minutes of quitting smoking leads to a drop in heart rate. Within 12 hours, the carbon monoxide level in a smoker’s blood drops to normal and within 2-12 weeks, blood circulation improves with a corresponding increase in lung function. Furthermore, in a spate of 1-9 months, coughing and shortness of breath decreases, and within 5-15 years, the stroke risk of the smoker is reduced to that of a non-smoker. Also, within a matter of 15 years, the risk of heart disease drops to normal levels as that of a non-smoker. The Authority has also referred smokers to various health facilities across the country to obtain counselling and cessation services. These facilities include the Addictive disease Centre at the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital, Accra Psychiatric Hospital, Pantang Psychiatric Hospital, Ankaful Psychiatric Hospital, Valley View Clinic, Adom Clinic (Kumasi), Sunyani Regional Hospital, Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital and the Ho Teaching Hospital. Meanwhile, Chief Executive of the FDA, Mrs Delese Mimi Darko has explained that the continuous enforcement of the comprehensive smoke free policies such as the ban on tobacco advertisement, fees on tobacco product importation, ban on public smoking and the corresponding introduction of punitive fines have helped to reduce the prevalence of tobacco use in Ghana.	bing									1.2 million people dying due to exposure to second-hand smoke from smokers.

In the UK alone, there's around 10million smokers but around two thirds of them want to give up the unhealthy habit.  While there are various methods out there to help cigarette-addicts quit, from nictotine replacement therapy to going cold turkey, studies have shown that hypnotherapy could be the best way to give up for good.  Like many other people, I was sceptical that any kind of quick fix could help me ditch cigarettes. But I decided to go for a hypnosis session to see if the treatment could cure my addiction in 60 minutes. I went to see celebrity hypnotherapist Susan Hepburn – who counts Adele and Lily Allen as her clients – at her Harley Street clinic after trying and failing to go cold turkey on my own.  When I got there, Susan asked if I had any cigarettes on me and told me to put the pack on the table next to me. After a chat about my life and habit, I got comfy in the reclining hypnotherapy chair and closed my eyes. Susan warned me that it wouldn’t feel like anything was happening and it didn’t, I just sat back and listened to her voice.  I didn’t even realise I was in a “hypnotic state” but apparently the clues are slow breathing, rapid eye movement and a relaxed jaw. Once the session had ended, it’s safe to say I didn’t really feel any different, but I walked out leaving the pack of fags on her table. When I thought about smoking, I knew I could easily light up but at the same time didn’t feel like I needed to and the cravings were gone.	google

REUTERS/Toby Melville By Nate Raymond (Reuters) - A group of vape shops in five U.S. states on Tuesday announced a trio of lawsuits challenging a rule adopted by the Food and Drug Administration that allows the regulator to treat e-cigarettes and similar devices like cigarettes. The vape shops, represented by the Pacific Legal Foundation conservative legal group, in lawsuits filed in federal courts in Texas, Minnesota and Washington, D.C., argued the 2016 rule was unconstitutional. The shops located in California, Michigan, Minnesota, North Dakota, and Texas argue that the so-called "Deeming Rule" that deems e-cigarettes to be tobacco products was not legally adopted because it was issued by a career FDA employee, rather than an officer appointed by the president. The lawsuits also contend that the rule violates the U.S. Constitution's free speech protections by requiring vape retailers to obtain the FDA's approval before advertising information about their products' health and related effects. "These regulations don't just harm small businesses and consumers, they undermine constitutional safeguards for individual liberty," Thomas Berry, a lawyer with Pacific Legal Foundation, said in a statement. The FDA declined to comment. The lawsuits come amid legal and legislative efforts by tobacco and vaping companies to derail the FDA rule, which was adopted during Democratic President Barack Obama's administration. In 2009, Congress passed a law allowing the FDA to extend its oversight to all tobacco products. The 2016 rule brought e-cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco and hookah tobacco in line with existing rules for cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. As a result, companies are now required to submit e-cigarettes and other newer tobacco products for government approval, list their ingredients and place health warnings on packages and in advertisements. E-cigarettes heat nicotine-laced liquid into vapor but do not contain tobacco. Big tobacco companies such as Altria Group Inc see vaping products as a promising business line and have lobbied alongside their smaller e-cigarette counterparts against the rule. The vape shops that filed the lawsuits announced on Tuesday contend that they were being subjected to burdensome rules that had hurt their ability to attract customers and restricted how that could advertise their businesses.	webhose.io	In 2009, Congress passed a law allowing the FDA to extend its oversight to all tobacco products.

The latest survey shows more middle and high schoolers using e-cigarettes instead of cigarettes or smokeless tobacco. 12%of high schoolers and 4.6% in middle school admitted to using e-cigs.    "The 7000 flavors that you can get, it doesn't cover up the fact that there still nicotine in the product," said Langston Moore with The Partnership for a Healthy Mississippi. "E-cigarettes contain nicotine. Nicotine is addictive. Nicotine can affect your brain just like heroin or cocaine. It's a dangerous product."    The Partnership for a Healthy Mississippi says e-cigs are the latest challenge in the fight for tobacco prevention. There are prevention programs like RAT (Reject All Tobacco) and Generation Free, a youth led initiative. Both are kept going through grant money from the Department of Health.    "The e-cigarette usage of middle schools has gone down about almost 2.1% in a year," said Moore. "We're reaching the kids with messages just like we do there to back her about the dangers and the effects of e-cigarettes."    The State Health Department noted this when discussing e-cigs, just because teens think it's safer doesn't mean it's safe.	google			12%of high schoolers and 4.6% in middle school admitted to using e-cigs.

U.S. health regulators will announce a new effort Thursday, April 29, 2021, to ban menthol cigarettes, according to an Biden administration official. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. health regulators pledged again Thursday to try to ban menthol cigarettes, this time under pressure from African American groups to remove the mint flavor popular among Black smokers. The Food and Drug Administration has attempted several times to get rid of menthol but faced pushback from Big Tobacco, members of Congress and competing political interests in both the Obama and Trump administrations. Any menthol ban will take years to implement and will likely face legal challenges from tobacco companies. Thursday’s announcement is the result of a lawsuit filed by anti-smoking and medical groups last summer to force the FDA to finally make a decision on menthol, alleging that regulators had “unreasonably delayed” responding to a 2013 petition seeking to ban the flavor. The deadline for the agency’s response was Thursday. The FDA said it aims to propose regulations banning the flavor in the coming year and declined to speculate on when the rule would be finalized. The action would also ban menthol and fruity flavors from low-cost, small cigars, which are increasingly popular with young people, especially Black teens. “We will save save hundreds of thousands of lives and prevent future generations from becoming addicted smokers,” said Dr. Janet Woodcock, the FDA’s acting commissioner. She cited research estimates that banning menthol would prevent 630,000 tobacco-related deaths over 40 years, more than a third of them among African Americans. Menthol is the only cigarette flavor that was not banned under the 2009 law that gave the FDA authority over tobacco products, an exemption negotiated by industry lobbyists. The act did, though, instruct the agency to continue to weigh banning menthol. The flavor’s persistence has infuriated anti-smoking advocates, who point to research that menthol’s numbing effect masks the harshness of smoking, likely making it easier to start and harder to quit. The mint-flavored cigarettes are overwhelmingly used by young people and minorities, particularly Black smokers, 85% of whom smoke menthols. That compares to about a third of white smokers. “The science is there, the data is there, so why are these products still on the market?” said Carol McGruder of the African American Tobacco Control Leadership Council. Her group sued along with Action on Smoking and Health, the American Medical Association and the National Medical Association, which represents Black physicians. After the FDA announcement the groups promised to keep pushing for swift implementation: “this is not the end of this fight, only the next stage.” For decades, companies focused menthol marketing and promotions on Black communities, including sponsoring music festivals and neighborhood events. Company documents released via 1990s litigation also show companies viewed menthol cigarettes as good “starter” products because they were more palatable for teenagers . “There was a specific, intentional focus on creating the next generation of smokers by making menthol cigarettes available in those communities,” said Dr. Nia Heard-Garris, who chairs the American Academy of Pediatrics’ group on minority health and equity. In the late 1990s, new restrictions banned cigarette advertising from billboards, public transit and most event sponsorships. Companies shifted more promotions to retail locations like gas stations and convenience stores, which researchers have shown are heavily concentrated in Black neighborhoods About a third of all cigarettes sold in the U.S. are menthol and its elimination would be a huge blow to tobacco companies, including Altria and Reynolds American, maker of the leading menthol brands, Newport and Kool. With the slow decline of smoking, tobacco companies have been diversifying into alternative products, including electronic cigarettes and tobacco pouches. But those ventures still account for a tiny slice of industry sales. A spokeswoman for Reynolds American said the company would submit evidence countering FDA’s proposal. “Published science does not support regulating menthol cigarettes differently from non-menthol,” she said in a statement. An Altria spokesman said in a statement that “criminalizing menthol” would have “serious unintended consequences.” The FDA stressed Thursday that its ban would only apply to manufacturers, distributors and retailers, not individuals. Smoking can cause cancer, strokes and heart attacks and is blamed for 480,000 deaths each year in the U.S. About 14% of Americans smoke cigarettes, with rates roughly even between white and Black populations. But Black smokers are less likely to successfully quit, a trend that the U.S. Surgeon General and others have attributed to menthol cigarettes. Menthol occurs naturally in mint plants. Known for its cooling effect, the chemical is used in cough drops and other medicines. Cigarette makers began adding the chemical in the 1920s after realizing it reduced the throat hit of cigarettes. Past government efforts targeting menthol have faced opposition from lawmakers from traditional tobacco states like North Carolina, but also some members of the Congressional Black Caucus, many who have received campaign contributions from cigarette makers. Some caucus members warned that banning menthol would create an illegal market for the products, subjecting Black communities to increased law enforcement. But calls for action have been growing and last year the House of Representatives voted to ban the flavor with support from the majority of Black members. The bill stalled in the Republican-controlled Senate after President Donald Trump made clear he opposed the measure. The FDA’s attempts to get rid of menthol have repeatedly been delayed or derailed by forces inside and outside government. In 2011, an outside panel of FDA advisers recommended banning menthol after concluding that it increases smoking among young people and minorities and makes it harder for them to quit. But cigarette makers challenged the findings in court, claiming some panel members had conflicts of interest they hadn’t disclosed. In 2013, the FDA conducted its own internal study and reached similar conclusions, but the Obama administration did not move ahead with a ban. Under the Trump administration, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb tried to again restart the process but it was never greenlighted by the White House. Massachusetts and California have passed laws banning menthol. But California’s ban was suspended in January after a legal challenge backed by tobacco companies; the issue is on the ballot next year. ___ Follow Matthew Perrone on Twitter: @AP_FDAwriter ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

92	f5211b70-0692-3936-9dc7-88ad98c6dd4b	Swedish Snus: A Less Risky Alternative	Swedish Match, the world’s leading manufacturer of Swedish snus, applied to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for a reduced harm warning label for their product; however an FDA advisory panel recommended rejecting the application late last week. The current label states that snus causes gum disease, mouth cancer and tooth loss and is addictive. Swedish Match’s requested labeling reads – Warning: No tobacco product is safe, but this product presents substantially lower risks to health than cigarettes. Swedish Match is amenable to including language referencing snus’ addictive properties. While the FDA is not obligated to follow the panel’s recommendation, it typically does.  Swedish Match’s modified risk tobacco product application is the first accepted for consideration by the FDA. Manufacturers must meet two criteria in order to qualify.  Swedish snus meets both of these criteria. It is a significantly less risky alternative to traditional tobacco products and has a proven track record as an effective smoking cessation tool.  Swedish snus, not to be confused with other oral tobacco products like chewing tobacco and American snuff, is a moist, smokeless tobacco that comes in small, teabag-like pouches that are placed beneath the upper lip. Because of the way Swedish snus is pasteurized, it has very low levels of nitrosamine– the naturally occurring carcinogenic compounds in tobacco.  The European Union (EU) Commission’s Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) has conducted exhaustive studies on the health risks and smoking cessation benefits associated with Swedish snus. Findings include:  Because Sweden is the only EU member nation where snus is manufactured and sold legally, Sweden and non-EU member Norway offer insights into Swedish snus’ potential risks and benefits. Snus was commonly used in Sweden but was supplanted by cigarettes after World War I. Swedish snus consumption rose dramatically in the 1970s because of health concerns over cigarette smoking, appearing to spur a reduction in cigarette use and leading to a decrease in smoking and tobacco-related diseases including lung and oral cancer. Between 1980 and 2011, the number of Swedish males who are daily smokers dropped from 35.1 percent to 12.7 percent; significantly lower than the EU’s average male smoking rate of 29 percent. At the same time, the number of daily male snus users in Sweden climbed to 19 percent. According to a National Institutes of Health (NIH) report on Swedish twins, “Snus use was the strongest independent correlate of smoking cessation,” suggesting that using snus helped Swedes to quit smoking.  Norway’s experience has mirrored Sweden’s. According to Karl Lund, Research Director at the Norwegian Institute for Alcohol and Drug Research, increased snus use has led to a drop in smoking from 37 percent in 1985 to 15 percent in 2013 among those aged 16-74. The UK’s Royal College of Physicians reported that, “in relation to cigarette smoking, the hazard profile of the lower-risk smokeless product is very favourable.”  Product labeling should provide consumers with accurate information to make informed purchasing decisions. Warning labels are appropriate for risky products. However, information about a product’s risk reduction properties also helps the public to make solid choices. While the EU has not lifted its Swedish snus ban, it has altered snus warning labels to read, “Snus can damage your health and is addictive.” Swedish Match has applied for similar wording from the FDA, which seems a reasonable request as Swedish snus is a significantly less risky alternative to traditional tobacco products and can aid with smoking cessation. The American people have a right to know both the risks and benefits associated with the products they buy.	bing										
93	50aeafeb-7fb6-3e9b-a23c-476a602aa202	Thirty-Year, Pack-A-Day Smoker Quitting Using E-Cigs	Follow below the squiggly thing for a brief history of my attempts to quit smoking...the methods I have tried, the amount of success I had, and my own feelings about the reasons why each of these previous attempts failed.  Over the years, I have tried, numerous times, to quit - and been unsuccessful every time...the longest I had ever gone without smoking was just over two weeks.  Even when I got my Gender Reassignment Surgery, and was warned to quit smoking for six weeks after the surgery, I found myself unable to comply with this directive, and resumed smoking a week after the surgery - even with the knowledge that any complications of my surgery would be blamed on my smoking.  This takes on additional significance when you understand I had my surgery halfway around the world, in Bangkok, Thailand, where there is no recourse for medical malpractice.  I have been a regular pack-a-day smoker since I was fourteen.  This is now thirty years.  This makes me what medical professionals would call a thirty pack-year smoker.  If I had been two packs a day for that time, I'd be considered a sixty pack-year smoker.  This is how medical professionals describe how long, and how much a smoker has been smoking.  Forgive my indulgence there, but, god...the satisfaction of inhaling and exhaling....is just UNDESCRIBABLE!!  For those of you who never smoked, I certainly don't mean to encourage smoking.  But you also have NO IDEA...the amount of sheer pleasure and satisfaction a smoker gets from the feel of holding a cigarette, from taking that drag....the flavor, and the exhale!  You simply have no idea the level of satisfaction a smoker gets from this.  And it is precisely for this reason - that all conventional methods of quitting smoking failed to provide this satisfaction - why all those attempts also failed, and failed miserably...within two weeks.  I tried quitting cold turkey.  This was the absolute worst, and the least successful method I ever tried.  This attempt was made in 2002, when I was in Bangkok, Thailand.  I lasted a week.  I had been, as I mentioned, advised to quit smoking for at least six weeks after the surgery.  I was advised that not quitting would complicate my recovery, and could lead to serious problems.  I still failed.  Threats from medical professionals - just don't help.  They are not a sufficient motivator for me.  And they certainly do not replace the satisfaction of smoking.  I tried the patch, I tried the gum.  None of them worked for more than a week to two weeks.  The gum generally didn't taste very good...and you weren't even supposed to actually CHEW it...just bite into it and then hold it in your mouth.  The patches always wanted to come off with the first sweat.  And neither provided the things I found enjoyable about smoking.  I tried regular gum.  Wrigley's Spearmint, to be exact.  This was the most-successful method of quitting I had tried prior to my most recent ongoing attempt, which I will get into in a few moments.  I lasted almost two and a half weeks on the Wrigley's Spearmint.  It at least provided a pleasant taste, a taste similar to the Menthol cigarettes I had been smoking.  But in the end, it wasn't enough.  I even tried not smoking indoors, even at home....failed.  I tried putting hard candy into all my ashtrays.  No biggie, just got me an empty Coke can, and used that as an ashtray!  The only thing I never tried was drugs.  Things like CHANTIX would not be a good option for me, given my history of depression.  There is also a potential side effect to CHANTIX, which makes it an option I would never consider:  Vivid and/or unusual dreams.  I had taken meds for my depression before, and the exact med I was taking produced this specific side effect.  I would wake up in the middle of the night, too terified to move...to even turn on the light over my bed - with my heart racing, and bathed in cold sweat.  I took myself off that medication and called my doctor, demanding something else, telling him I was not going to go through what I was going through anymore...it was worse than the original condition for which the medication had been prescribed.  I also tried early versions of E-cigarettes...the kind with a "cartomizer" that you changed out every day or two.  They didn't work for me, because you could never get a decent drag on them...and they tasted filthy.  The kind I am talking about here are the kind that really look like a cigarette...and the tip even glows when you drag on it.  Did not work for me.  Utterly failed to deliver the kind of satisfaction I needed.  Recently, I moved to North Carolina.  I was happy about one aspect of the move right off....CHEAP CIGARETTES!!  Cigarettes are twenty bucks cheaper a carton here than in Pennsylvania, where I had moved from.  Prices in Massachusetts are just insane...over nine bucks a pack.  Yet I broke down and bought some, even in Massachusetts, when on a trip up there recently, I had not brought along enough cigarettes to last my trip.  So higher and higher prices were no motivation for me to quit, either.  I still remember buying cigarettes for my dad, when I was a kid.  They were 55 cents a pack then, and a kid could buy them from stores, with a signed note from the adult parent.  One could also get them from vending machines.  I remember when they first went over a buck a pack...and how folks all around me would say that they would quit if smokes went over two bucks a pack.  They did.  And those same people did not quit.  When I began smoking, they were just under $2.50 a pack.  Now, I could pay about five bucks a pack here in North Carolina...or nearly seven dollars a pack in Pennsylvania.  My move to North Carolina happened to introduce me to a method of quitting smoking that I have found which may actually work!  At the very least, it provides me with everything I enjoy about smoking (and some side benefits outside of the health issues)  I attended a local "Harvest Festival" in my new town, Wendell, NC about a week after moving here.  And there I happened upon a vendor selling a new kind of e-cigarette I had never seen before.  This device did not have a "cartomizer" it had a tank you filled with liquid...and many flavors to choose from.  I knew immediately I had found the sort of thing that JUST MIGHT be successful.  Yet, controversy swirls among health agencies and health professionals concerning the effectiveness of "vaping" as a method of quitting or reducing smoking.  Certainly, "vaping" is probably not as healthy as not smoking or vaping at all...but, if the choice is between smoking conventional cigarettes versus "vaping" I cannot see how "vaping" is not the better choice.  Certainly it cannot POSSIBLY be more harmful, and, in the time I have been vaping, I have noticed certain health benefits from quitting conventional cigarettes....even though I have replaced them with vaping.  That, right there, I think is the main reason why "vaping" has been looked upon by many health professionals, and health organizations as not beneficial to quitting smoking.  They have a vested interest in continuing to sell us "stop smoking" products that do not satisfy, and therefore, do not work.  There are, also, those who believe that the variety of flavors might entice young people to take up vaping...which could then lead to them smoking conventional cigarettes.  (Link)  I disagree.  First of all, conventional cigarettes do NOT come in the flavors that would entice the young to take up vaping.  Secondly, when I first began vaping...I was weaning myself off conventional cigarettes.  I had five packs of conventional cigarettes...and they lasted me three weeks (normally, in the same time period I would have smoked just over two cartons) - and towards the end of that "wean-off" period...I began to discover that, to me, the conventional cigarette tasted dirty and filthy compared to vaping.  Thus I think it very unlikely anyone would choose to take up smoking as a replacement to vaping.  So...for those who do not really know what these e-cigarettes are (some call them hookah pipes, by the way, although, in reality, hookah pipes are different from e-cigarettes) This Wikipedia Article explains what e-cigarettes are and how they work.  Note that the e-cigarettes I had tried previously, and failed with...were so-called "first generation" devices.  What I use now is best described as a "second generation" device.  I'm not really handy and experienced enough to try some of the "third generation" devices now available.  I certainly do not mean to suggest that vaping is harmless, quite the contrary, there ARE potential harms and risks involved in vaping...many of those risks involve mishandling of the "e-liquid" that is used in second and third generation devices.  The controversy rages on, and one is given to wonder what interests each side has in the position they have taken on the subject of vaping.  But if I am to be an example, I am currently 24 days completely quit smoking - and that is longer quit than any other method I have ever tried.  So those who say there is not enough empirical evidence that they are beneficial to smokers who want to quit...they haven't talked to me...or to many of the people I have met in some of the local "vape lounges" who, like me, were long-term smokers who sought, for various reasons, a better alternative to smoking.  We Should Cheer E-Cigarettes, Not Condemn Them!!  Prior to my taking up vaping and quitting smoking...I used to have a half-hour-long coughing fit every morning on waking up...and again on first going to bed at night.  Since I have totally quit smoking and only vape...no more coughing fits!  Additionally, vaping gives me the satisfaction of handling a cigarette...of tasting the cigarette, and of inhaling and exhaling.  Not to mention, I have found that cinnamon-flavor vape is very nice!  I rotate between four flavors currently....Extreme Ice, Candy Cane, Cinnamon, and Menthol.  I get the satisfaction and the pleasures of smoking, without the over 7,000 harmful chemicals delivered by conventional cigarettes.  Also, I can adjust the level of nicotine I get in a number of ways...I can buy e-liquid in different strengths, I can adjust up or down the voltage - and these are things one cannot do with conventional cigarettes!  This gives me an opportunity to slowly wean myself off the nicotine entirely...which still enjoying the pleasures I associate with smoking.  They even make e-liquid which contains no nicotine whatsoever.  I cannot see myself giving up vaping, but, cutting down the nicotine level is something I will likely do.  Twenty-four days and counting.  My longest success rate in attempting quitting thus far.  Take that, Pennsylvania Medical Society!  Take that, WHO!!  Take that, UN Health Agency!  Now how can that be a bad thing?	bing		My move to North Carolina happened to introduce me to a method of quitting smoking that I have found which may actually work!								
94	b1792359-5c91-3d2f-9e92-02e449ade2d2	E-cigs, apps and the FDA's push to limit nicotine	Smoking cessation expert Dr. Jonathan Bricker weighs in on new studies and a federal effort to regulate an ‘astonishingly addictive’ drug  Aug. 1, 2017  |  By Diane Mapes / Fred Hutch News Service  FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb announced Friday that the agency plans to cut back on the level of nicotine in cigarettes. "We must do more to help Americans and their families lead healthier lives, and to avoid or break free from harmful cigarette addiction," he said. "The key lies in taking a new and comprehensive approach to the regulation of nicotine."  AFP file via Getty Images  Smoking is in the news again with a new study touting the usefulness of e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation tool and an announcement from the Food and Drug Administration regarding their plans to cut back on nicotine, an “astonishingly addictive” drug that keeps people hooked, usually from a young age.  The FDA’s move was announced Friday by its new commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who referred to nicotine and the smoke particles it attaches itself to as an “addictive chemical mix of disease and death.”  “We need to envision a world where cigarettes lose their addictive potential through reduced nicotine levels,” Gottlieb said of the FDA’s proposed plan. “Cigarettes will likely remain incredibly toxic, what with the presence of over 7,000 chemicals in cigarette smoke. But with a balanced regulatory approach, we may be able to reach a day when the most harmful products are no longer capable of addicting our kids.”  What does all this mean and what’s the science behind it? We turned to Dr. Jonathan Bricker, a psychologist and smoking cessation expert with Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center’s Public Health Sciences Division for answers. Bricker and his team have created a handful of tools, some of which rely on acceptance and commitment therapy, or ACT, to help smokers acknowledge, and eventually overcome, their cravings. Most recently, he’s teamed up with CVS Health Foundation to support cancer patients who want to kick their nicotine addiction.  Fred Hutch public health researcher Dr. Jonathan Bricker  Photo by Robert Hood / Fred Hutch News Service  First, let’s talk about the idea of reducing the amount of nicotine in cigarettes. Can the FDA do that? And would that also include limiting nicotine in e-cigs?  Yes, it is within the authority of the FDA to do this, through something known as the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, which was passed in 2009. That act allows the FDA to set standards for how much nicotine is in a cigarette.  The FDA is regulating the manufacture of e-cigarettes and vaping devices, as well, and regulating the nicotine content in those devices. That's separate from what they're doing with combustible cigarettes — there's a phase-in period of several years. But they are going to regulate the manufacture of e-cigarettes, which includes the nicotine content, the method of extracting the nicotine and they're also going to limit the marketing of flavors that we know appeal to children.  Going after the chemical that hooks people seems pretty logical. What do you think of the idea?  It’s a smart strategy. On a population level, a policy like this would serve two functions: It would help adult smokers quit because they’d be reducing their addiction level over time and it would keep young people from smoking and becoming addicted. It would prevent progression of smoking in youth and help reduce smoking addiction in adults. Those are very good things.  And it’s actually an old idea, proposed by some colleagues of mine back in 1994, that’s finally getting some traction. The FDA will seek input from scientists, from the public and from industry to determine how to shape the policy and ensure that it’s being properly implemented by the manufacturers. We won’t see it take shape for maybe three years.  Nonetheless, it’s a big deal that they’re reviewing it and taking this part of tobacco control science seriously enough to entertain and pursue it. It’s good news from that perspective.  It seems like good news. Why has it taken 23 years to get to this point?  The main reason we’ve had to wait is because of the tobacco industry. They have a lot of lobbyists and they have a lot of say and control, and there’s been industry resistance to this idea. As soon as the news came out that the FDA intended to seek input for a policy change, the stocks for tobacco products dropped. There’s a huge financial reason for Big Tobacco to resist this type of policy.  Is that the only reason?  No, the other reason is you have to figure out what level to reduce the amount of nicotine to and that’s an experimental question, a laboratory question. And the devil is in the details.  There’s not a consensus among the scientific community as to what the level should be. What it takes for one person to become addicted may be more nicotine than for another person. There are individual differences in our biology. If we’re going to do a massive change at a population level, we have to figure out what the level should be.  There have been some studies that suggest reducing it to about half a milligram provides less pleasure for smokers. But getting the number right is important.  Why not just take nicotine out of cigarettes completely?  You could, in concept, but the FDA does not have the authority to remove all nicotine from cigarettes. It’s a part of the law and the way it’s written. They cannot remove it completely. But the FDA does have the authority to lower the amount of nicotine in cigarettes. That’s where we are.  So how do they do it? Through genetic engineering? Or is it more like decaffeinating coffee?  You can genetically engineer the tobacco plants or chemically extract nicotine levels after the fact, just like they do with caffeine and coffee beans.  There are about 10 to 15 milligrams of nicotine in one cigarette. But the amount of nicotine that a smoker takes in when he or she smokes is about 1 to 2 milligrams per cigarette. If you can lower the content so that you get about a half milligram, then you can reduce the reinforcing qualities of nicotine, the level of pleasure you get from smoking that cigarette. It becomes less enjoyable and therefore less addicting.  They’re sort of putting a lock on the cigarette, limiting how much nicotine is in the cigarette to begin with.  But nicotine isn’t the only harmful thing in cigarettes? It's just the most addictive thing, correct?  Yes, they actually add other chemicals to make cigarettes more addictive. They add benzene and fluorine and chlorine and ammonia. When they are combined and they bind to the nicotine, cigarettes become much more addictive.  Big Tobacco’s goal is to get the nicotine to cross the blood-brain barrier more quickly. The quicker you cross this barrier, the more addictive the substance will be. Cigarette manufacturing is really a chemistry question: How do we manipulate this substance so it will cross the blood-brain barrier faster so people will use this product more than that product? It’s what differentiates the product — the flavor and how fast it crosses the blood-brain barrier.  Could those other chemicals still be added even if the nicotine levels are lowered?  Yes, they could. There’s a whole area of National Institutes of Health-funded research called tobacco regulatory science, and the purpose is to do these types of studies to help inform policy for questions just like this.  Should we also regulate how much ammonia is in cigarettes? I hope so. But it’s a chemistry question and that’s why tobacco regulatory science exists. It got started after the 2009 act.  The FDA is going to be listening very closely to see what scientists have learned about how the other additives interact. Scientists have become important stakeholders in influencing policy. Hopefully, the new director of the FDA will listen.  Speaking of science, a new studypublished Thursday in the British Medical Journal suggests e-cigarettes can help people quit traditional cigarettes. Or is that overstating it?  Unfortunately, the BMJ study is not conclusive because of the way it was designed. It’s a cross-sectional survey, and it’s looking at the quit rates for combustible tobacco products among people who used e-cigarettes versus those who haven’t used e-cigarettes. The study found the quit rate was higher in people who used e-cigs versus the people who did not.  But that’s just one conclusion. The other conclusion you could make is that the people they surveyed were going to quit combustible cigarettes anyway and switching to e-cigarettes was just one of many things they were doing. They were motivated and may have been using other aids like a patch or nicotine gum to help them quit.  To prove that e-cigarettes can help you quit smoking, you have to design a randomized controlled trial. With that type of design, you could make a strong causal argument as to whether e-cigarettes help you quit smoking. This study is an important step in the evidence base, but because of the design, it’s a limited step.  Where are you with regard to your own smoking studies?  We are recruiting now for the new ICanQuit.org study. This study will compare two different apps for smoking cessation and the goal is to determine the effectiveness of both apps.  We’re looking for adults who smoke at least five cigarettes a day who’d like to quit in the next 30 days. It’s a national study and is all online, so no blood draws, no driving to Fred Hutch. It’s really simple. We’re recruiting 2,000 people and each of them can earn up to $105 for participating.  We’re testing cutting-edge app technology. We’re integrating the latest in addiction science, the data we’ve gleaned from our prior research trials and the latest innovations in software technology and design to make the apps engaging and enjoyable and useful for consumers.  It’s a double-blind study so we can’t say what’s in the apps or how they’re different from each other. People will be randomly assigned, like a coin toss. But both apps use science-based techniques to help them quit smoking. It’s a win-win for participants.  Diane Mapes is a staff writer at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.

Using 2021 data, the study found 2 million U.S. middle and high school students reported currently using e-cigarettes. Additionally, 85% of those youth reported using flavored e-cigarettes, with disposable e-cigarettes as the most popular. The epidemic of youth e-cigarette use did not go away. We’ve got a lot of work to do to turn these numbers around. E-cigarettes carry real health risks for young people. The nicotine in e-cigarettes can harm the developing adolescent brain, specifically the parts that control learning and memory. The SCA continues to educate youth about the harms of e-cigarette use, encouraging them to quit, and letting them know it is possible. One new resource for teens is the Live Vape Free text line – text “VAPEFREE” to 873373.

Reported by Carl Quintanilla, the hour-long documentary explores the contentious debate over e-cigarettes. While some believe their sales should be restricted to prevent teens from vaping, others claim stricter regulation could cost the lives of many adult cigarette smokers who use e-cigarettes to help them quit. CNBC gets unprecedented access to Juul Labs, the upstart e-cigarette company whose innovative product design and marketing have made it the vaping industry leader. Quintanilla speaks with Juul executives about its remarkable growth as well as its reputation for making the most popular vaping products among adolescents. Among the most pressing concerns over vaping is its overwhelming popularity among teenagers, which critics attribute to the industry's shrewd exploitation of social media marketing, as well as a staggering array of enticing flavors. Quintanilla reports in-depth on the efforts of the government, parents and schools to stop vaping's explosive growth, and also profiles high school-aged vapers from across the country and a young social media influencer who says he earns his living by touting the 'cool' factor of e-cigarettes. Quintanilla's reporting takes him into the heart of the vaping epidemic in West Virginia. The state with the unfortunate distinction of having the nation's highest adult smoking rate also has a hard-earned expertise in respiratory illness stemming from its long experience with Black Lung Disease among coal miners. Researchers at West Virginia University are among the first to look holistically at vaping behavior, and offer substantial evidence in the case against e-cigarettes. Quintanilla also travels to London where the U.K. government openly promotes vaping as a means to stop adult smoking. A prominent researcher tells him that, in the absence of long-term human studies on e-cigarettes, smokers should opt for them to avoid the certain dangers of cigarettes. 'Vaporized: America's e-Cigarette Addiction' provides a timely guide to the vaping phenomenon. In compelling fashion, it explains how and why this highly addictive and controversial habit has become so big so fast.

India ordered that from April 1, 85 percent of a cigarette pack’s surface had to be covered in health warnings, up from 20 percent, but cigarette firms halted production saying the policy was not clear.  India’s $11 billion tobacco industry is up in arms against the new rules and has taken the government to court. Industry estimates show the production halt has already cost $850 million and risks the livelihood of millions of farmers.  In a statement to the Indian stock exchange late on Friday, ITC, part-owned by British American Tobacco, said: “Consequent upon a high court order passed in favor of the company, the company will soon resume manufacture of cigarettes in its factories”.  An ITC spokesman declined on Saturday to elaborate on ITC’s statement to the stock exchange. Its statement gave no details of its court appeal or any subsequent orders.  The company also did not address whether it would print bigger health warnings on its packs. ITC said earlier this month it was not ready to print bigger, “excessive” health warnings. It also said the government was implementing new rules despite a parliamentary panel report that called for the size of the warnings to be reduced.  But the panel’s report is not binding on the government, and health ministry officials have maintained that manufacturers must comply with the new rules.  Smoking kills more than 1 million people a year in India, according to BMJ Global Health. The World Health Organization says tobacco-related diseases cost the country $16 billion annually.	google	India ordered that from April 1, 85 percent of a cigarette pack’s surface had to be covered in health warnings,

In this seminar, President PANAH Major Gen (R) Masud Kiani talked to media and said that 90% of the diseases were caused due to smoking. Approximately more than 5,000 people are admitted to hospitals and over 300 people died due to smoking on daily basis and according to a survey, by increasing prices of cigarettes, its consumption significantly reduced. Speakers in the seminar showed deep concerns about future of their children. Every year, 1,400 new children started smoking and number of girls starting smoking is greater than before. We strongly request the government to take steps for prevention of smoking and to make cigarettes out of reaches of people, especially children. The simple solution to this problem is that price of cigarettes is set so high that general public and children cannot purchase it, they said. This will also help to reduce expenditure incurred by government on health, they argued.	rss

Over six million adults in England still smoke, and it remains the leading cause of premature death, with almost 75,000 preventable deaths a year. 'Each cigarette fills our lungs with toxins which harm the immune system and leave us more vulnerable to infections' In Kent, figures for 2019 showed that 13.7% of residents smoked. Although this was a record low across the county, health experts fear numbers may have increased during the pandemic. Kent County Council’s Director for Public Health, Allison Duggal, said: “We know that the pandemic created lots of stressful and challenging situations and early indications show that people may have started or resumed smoking as a way of coping during the pandemic. "However, we also know the links between smoking and serious health implications if you get Covid as smoking damages the lungs and airways, making it harder to breathe. "Each cigarette fills our lungs with toxins which harm the immune system and leave us more vulnerable to infections.” She adds: “It’s never too late to quit – stopping smoking brings immediate benefits to health, including for people with an existing smoking-related disease. "Stoptober offers a range of free quitting support including the NHS Quit Smoking app while expert support from local One You Kent stop smoking services gives people the best chance of success. "GPs and pharmacists can also give advice and tips to help smokers quit, including what prescription medicines might be right for them. Find out more now at www.kent.gov.uk/stoptober” A new nationwide survey of 2,000 current smokers found that nearly half (45%) have been smoking more since the first lockdown began. Key reasons reported are being bored in the lockdowns (43%) or the pandemic making them more anxious (42%). "What’s more, data from the monthly UCL Smoking Toolkit Study indicates a large increase in smoking among the under-35s since the coronavirus pandemic, up from 18% in 2019 to 24% now. As a result of increased smoking behaviours, this year's Stoptober is more important than ever and is encouraging smokers to join the thousands of others who are giving quitting a go for the month of October, and getting to experience the benefits of giving up smoking including being able to start moving better, being able to breathe more easily and saving money. Stoptober offers a range of free quitting tools including: the NHS Quit Smoking app, Facebook messenger bot, Stoptober Facebook online communities, daily emails and SMS, and an online Personal Quit Plan. Susan Piddock, One You Kent’s Professional Lead for Stop Smoking, said: “We know it’s tough to quit smoking, but you don’t have to go it alone and you are more likely to succeed with our support. If you can quit for 28 days, you are five times more likely to quit for good so why not give it a go? “Our NHS trained smokefree advisers offer free, friendly support when you need it most, including free nicotine replacement therapy. "We’ve supported over 3000 smokers to quit over the past year. Stopping smoking is the best thing you can do for your health and Stoptober is an ideal opportunity to quit.” Information on Stoptober, along with online help, apps and ways to contact local One You Kent support services can be found at www.kent.gov.uk/stoptober	google_alerts

102	de485110-c0f4-3ad3-8673-dd9d4b1e56b8	Anti-smoking group praise DOH move not to ban vape - The	Quit for good, an anti-tobacco advocacy group, lauded the Department of Health’s new stand to regulate vaping products after the joint meeting of the Committee on Trade and Industry and Committee on Health on electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) and electronic non-nicotine delivery systems (ENNDS) on December 2 at the House of Representatives. According to Dr. Lorenzo Mata, president of Quit for Good, while the agency’s staunch pursuit to safeguard the health of its citizens is laudable, a total ban on vaping products can lead to unintended consequences. “A clampdown on electronic cigarettes and other vaping devices can lead former cigarette users to take up the harmful habit of smoking once again – we definitely do not want that to happen, seeing how it has resulted in P270 billion in healthcare and productivity losses for the country,” he explained in an interview. In his speech before the two committees, Dr. Mata cited various scientific studies presented in The E-Cigarette Summit held in London, England last month that showed the efficacy of ENDS over nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs). Apart from being more expensive, those that used NRTs had lower success rates in terms of adherence, or the rate where former smokers stayed off the use of cigarettes.

The Ontario Restaurant, Hotel and Motel Association says some of its members fear they will lose business if customers can no longer smoke on their patios, and complains the government never consulted the industry about the change.  However, groups like the Canadian Cancer Society and the Heart and Stroke Foundation applaud the proposed smoking ban on patios.  Health Minister Deb Matthew says she's just like the majority of people who don't want to be exposed to second hand smoke.  Matthews also announced a ban on sales of tobacco on college and university campuses and the doubling of fines for stores that sell cigarettes to minors.  And she said Ontario will also move to prohibit all sales of candy- and fruit-flavoured tobacco products, expanding the existing ban on sales of those items to minors.	bing

The legislation would ensure that Internet and mail order sales of e-cigarettes are treated the same way as traditional tobacco products.  “Under federal law, if you want to buy cigarettes, rolling tobacco, chewing tobacco, or snuff online, by mail, or over the phone, you have to verify your age, both when you order and when you receive the package,” DeLauro said. “Unfortunately, the law is deficient. It does not cover all tobacco products. People can buy cigars, hookah, and e-cigarettes online, by mail, or on the phone, without facing any age verification requirements. That is why Congresswoman Esty and I are introducing the Stop Tobacco Sales to Youth Act to close this loophole and keep our children safe from tobacco products in the 21st Century.”  The Stop Tobacco Sales to Youth Act would:  “The bill that we are introducing today will continue the progress we’ve made on reducing the use of tobacco and nicotine among America’s youth,” Esty said. “It’s easier and cheaper for children to obtain electronic nicotine and tobacco online. And we need to put an end to these dangerous practices. The same laws that apply to the sale of other tobacco products should apply to e-cigarettes, and that’s what this bill does. This is common sense legislation to promote a healthier Connecticut and a healthier America.”  DeLauro represents the Third District, which includes Ansonia, Derby and Seymour. Esty represents the Fifth District, which includes Litchfield and a portion of Fairfield counties.  Democratic Congressmen John Garamendi, Bobby Rush and Charles Rangel are also original co-sponsors of the bill.	google										
105	c4d4c142-6a28-3446-8e25-f13ca8216bf5	Making Malaysia a tobacco-free nation	Technically speaking, vaping products are not legal in Malaysia, and have also been declared haram by the National Fatwa Council. — Filepic A 2016 Health Ministry study showed that at least 600,000 children between 11- to 18-years-old in Malaysia are vaping. This is an unacceptable number, and begs the need for a new and stronger Tobacco Act. Decisions are currently being made about vaping in Malaysia, which has long-term harms, without adequate public scrutiny during this Covid-19 pandemic. In today’s column, we examine the facts of vaping, how invisible policy decisions can damage the lives of Malaysians, and propose three solutions. Five facts Here are five facts about tobacco and vaping. One, Malaysia is a party to the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) launched by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2003, which is the world’s first treaty on public health. As a party, Malaysia must commit to reducing tobacco demand using price (like taxes) and non-price (like regulations on labelling, packaging and content) measures. Two, tobacco is harmful and leads to diseases such as coronary heart disease, cancers and chronic lung disease. Tobacco is the main cause of death worldwide, related to eight million deaths every year. In Malaysia, the 2019 National Health and Morbidity Survey (NHMS) estimated that five million Malaysians above 15 years of age are smokers. The smoking habit kills 20,000 Malaysians every year, while the cost of treating just three smoking-related diseases is estimated at RM3 billion annually. Three, it is not completely true that vaping is less harmful than smoking, although the vaping industry argues that it is a safer alternative. There is significant evidence that e-cigarettes contain harmful substances such as diacetyl (a chemical linked to a serious lung disease), cancer-causing chemicals, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and heavy metals such as nickel, tin or lead. E-cigarettes have been linked to thousands of cases of E-cigarette or Vaping-Associated Lung Injury (EVALI), some resulting in death. Four, there is significant evidence that shows young people who vape are more likely to progress to cigarettes. In other words, vaping is a “gateway activity” to cigarettes. There is also evidence that e-cigarettes do not help smokers who want to quit, instead turning them into dual users of cigarettes and e-cigarettes. And there is evidence that e-cigarettes are increasingly used by youths and children, especially with false and misleading adver- tising. Fifth, Big Tobacco is rich and powerful, spending tens of millions of dollars on lobbying annually. Vaping and e-cigarette companies are catching up with “traditional tobacco companies”, with one vaping company increasing their lobbying spending by 1,220% between 2017 to 2018. Traditional tobacco companies are also expanding into vape and e-cigarettes as their new commercial strategy because of intense political action against smoking. In 2018 for example, 96% of all vaping sales in the United States were connected to Big Tobacco. We cannot let Big Tobacco open another channel to increase profits by harming Malaysians with vaping products. Vaping tax In Malaysia, tobacco products are regulated by the Control of Tobacco Product Regulations 2004, which is under the Food Act 1983. A separate and full-fledged Tobacco Act has been mooted since 2016, but it remains at the Attorney-General’s Chambers and has not yet been tabled in Parliament. In October 2020, the Finance Minister announced that a new e-cigarette and vape tax would be introduced this year (2021). This is ill-advised and contrary to Malaysia’s obligations to the FCTC and the Sustainable Develop-ment Goals (SDGs) to reduce tobacco use. It required Malaysia’s Children’s Commissioner to urge the government to ban or prohibit vaping in adults, as well as children, in May (2021). Recently, we heard that the previous Cabinet approved this plan to collect taxes on nicotine in vaping products. However, there are no published statements by the previous or current Cabinets on this issue. We urge transparency on this important issue. This decision comes after years of sustained pressure on the government to approve taxes on vaping products. For example, the Retail and Trade Brands Advocacy Malaysia Chapter claims that Malaysia can make up to RM300 million a year in taxing nicotine in vaping products “if appropriate vape regulations are introduced”. This group went on to say that “this will spur and generate economic activities in this growing industry”. We strongly disagree. Taxing nicotine is intended to reduce nicotine and tobacco usage, not to raise taxes and certainly not to grow the economy. Anyone who says that Malaysia relies on tobacco jobs is also wrong. Malaysia already has zero tobacco plantations and the tobacco industry provides zero benefits to rural communities. To be absolutely clear, we strongly disagree with any decision to collect taxes from nicotine in vaping products for health and equity reasons. There is another reason for this: technically speaking, vaping products are not legal in Malaysia. Therefore, we cannot tax a product that is not explicitly legalised. Getting rid of smoking Our stance is clear: Malaysia should aim to become a tobacco-free nation before 2040. This means that we should explicitly ban vaping products in Malaysia. This will allow Malaysia to be consistent with the National Fatwa Council that declared e-cigarettes to be haram (in 2015), following their 1995 fatwa that smoking is haram. An explicit ban on vaping products will also bring Malaysia up to the standards of Brunei, Cambodia, Singapore and Thailand. In parallel, we recommend passing the Tobacco Control Act. Malaysia needs such a full-fledged Act that can cater to the increasing number of tobacco and vaping products available. Such an Act can also mitigate the innovativeness and strong lobbying activities of the tobacco and vaping industry. A strong law must be supported by strong price/non-price measures (led by the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry), public education (led by the Health, Education and Communications Minis-tries), smoking cessation programmes (led by the Health Ministry), and action against smuggling (led by the Customs Department). In other words, a law alone is not adequate to fight tobacco usage. In summary, Malaysia needs to simultaneously ban vaping and take stronger action against cigarettes. Otherwise, a ban on vaping will only drive more people to use cigarettes, which could counteract all the benefits of banning vaping. Therefore, we need a stronger set of policies against tobacco, while also banning vaping. The Rakyat deserves smoke-free environments and protection from second-hand smoke exposure. Therefore, Malaysia must prioritise the implementation of tobacco control measures, starting with transparency of Cabinet discussions and decisions on vaping.

Annals of Work Exposures and Health. https://doi.org/10.1093/annweh/wxab019 Abstract: Exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke (SHS) in the workplace has been largely controlled in most workplaces in many countries that have adopted smoke-free laws and regulations. Workers in offices, bars, restaurants, and many other settings have experienced substantial reductions in the frequency and intensity of their exposure to SHS. While current exposure to SHS of most non-smoking adults arises from living with a smoker there are likely to be some jobs where non-negligible exposure to SHS continues to occur. This study describes the development of a simple job exposure matrix (JEM) for SHS exposure for the UK working population in 2020 and identifies that at least 1.04 million workers are likely to be exposed to SHS while performing their job. Occupations with the highest frequency and intensity of exposure include those where workers carry out work tasks in private, domestic settings: including care workers and home carers. This SHS-JEM provides a novel method for assessing occupational exposure to SHS in other countries, and can act as a tool to identify priorities for policies to protect those workers who continue to be at risk from SHS.

108	ed0743bc-f06f-3a09-9db9-ea3df9b0a5aa	Letter: E-cigarettes helping smokers kick the habit	The talk of banning e-cigarettes and e-liquids has me beyond frustrated. I am one of the thousands of success stories related to the use of an alternative device that has proven to be the smoking cessation product I have been hoping for. With a diagnosis of COPD after 40 years of smoking cigarettes, I tried many times but couldn’t quit.  Nicotine is the addiction. The more than 4,000 chemicals tobacco companies deem necessary to incorporate into their product was causing the harm. Apparently the Food and Drug Administration is OK with that, otherwise cigarettes would be, without question, off the market, or tobacco companies would be forced to exclude ingredients such as butane from their products, which is not the case here.  I now am tobacco-free. I feel better, breathe better and have no need for the albuterol that had been prescribed for the last four years – all after 10 months. Here’s the shock: The “juvenile flavors” are what made me successful. The claim that e-liquid flavors are directed at kids is too lame to repeat. Adults have enjoyed flavors since the beginning of time, so that argument has just been debunked. People are quitting a highly toxic product by means of a cleaner alternative with its contents found in everyday consumption, like “flavored” drops that enhance plain old water.  The powers that be need to quit dictating what “they” think is best for us; we all have free will. I began smoking when I was extremely young, and no law stopped me. If kids want to smoke, they will. After my terrifying experience with tainted tobacco, I’d rather see them with an e-cigarette.	bing

"It seems very clear that medications can help. They're not the magic bullet but you do improve your chances of quitting - generally - if you try them. And as far as we can tell, they're safe to use," said Kate Cahill, who led the study.  Several reviews have looked at the effectiveness of smoking cessation treatments, but the researchers wanted to put those results into a single large review to help people who want to use medical treatments to stop smoking, Cahill, a senior researcher for the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group at the University of Oxford, UK, told Reuters Health.  About one fifth of the U.S. and UK populations are current smokers, according to the researchers. Previous studies have found between 70 per cent and 75 per cent want to quit, but only about 3 per cent accomplish that every year.  For the new study, the researchers pulled data from 12 reviews published by the Cochrane Collaboration, an international research organization that evaluates medical evidence. Those analyses, which were conducted between 2008 and 2012, included data from 267 studies of more than 101,000 smokers.  The studies typically compared smokers trying to quit without the help of a smoking cessation treatment to smokers using nicotine replacement therapies, such as nicotine gum and patches, or prescription drugs.  The medications include varenicline (marketed by Pfizer as Chantix or Champix) and bupropion (marketed by GlaxoSmithKline as Zyban or Wellbutrin, but available as a generic).  The researchers found that the nicotine replacement therapies and the antidepressant bupropion led about eighteen people to successfully give up smoking for every 10 people who quit without treatments.

Councillor Phillip Martin said there should be a smoking ban introduced over all of the Parklands because of the fire risk posed by stray cigarette butts.  “Many parts of the Parklands are tinder dry and all it would take is one act of recklessness to create a catastrophe,” he said.  “The potential for a discarded cigarette butt to create a fire that threatens the Parklands and surrounding structures including homes is not something we should ignore.  “If it (a fire) happened on one of Adelaide’s hot and windy days then it could be catastrophic.”  Mr Martin said the areas around Robe Tce were extremely dry.  “There is a real risk of having hectares (of the Parklands) being burnt as the result of one irresponsible act,” he said.  Mr Martin, a former smoker who has campaigned for stricter enforcement of the Rundle Mall ban, said making the Parklands smoke free would potentially prevent people suffering health issues.  “There’s not only the risk to the individual (smoking) but also others around them,” he said.  “Second-hand smoke has been proven to be dangerous to people’s health and I find it offensive.”  But Adelaide Parklands Preservation Association president Ian Gilfillan said smoking bans should only be introduced in popular areas.  “I personally believe a blanket ban would be too draconian,” he said.  “There are parts of the Parklands, such as those areas very popular for people to go running or families to congregate, that a ban would be appropriate.  “I think there is scope to work out the areas which would be suitable for a ban while still leaving other areas of the Parklands available to smokers.”  Lord Mayor Martin Haese said he would consider introducing a ban in some areas of the Parklands if it was widely supported by the community.  “Any proposal regarding smoking restrictions in our Park Lands would need to be considered very carefully.  “I am happy to investigate restrictions in relation to proximity to sporting activities, should it be raised by the local community, however I do not support the idea of a blanket smoking ban throughout the entirety of the Park Lands.  “In the new year, (the) council will consider its policy position on smoking in relation to the Smoking Bans in Public Areas legislation. Such proposals can be considered then as part of this review.”  Mr Haese said smoking was already banned in Rundle Mall and within 10 metres of playgrounds.	bing

These releases reflect the views of the issuing entity and are not reviewed or edited by the Sacramento Bee staff. More information on PR Newswire can be found on their web site . You can contact the service with questions or concerns here  /PRNewswire-iReach/ -- RAD Vapor, a leading electronic cigarette manufacturer, recently launched two experiential rock n' roll themed flagship stores in the popular beach community of Encinitas, CA and the relaxed mountain town of Colorado Springs, CO.  With the newness of the industry and the variety of e liquid flavors, a brick and mortar store is still an important part of the business model.  "The feedback we're getting from visitors has been great because they're learning about electronic cigarettes and higher end vaporizes and tasting the variety of E liquid flavors in a friendly and comfortable environment. Many smokers who are seeking this alternative to tobacco cigarettes are a bit intimidated about the variety of devices and the multitude of flavors" Stern says.  "Our ergonomic and high quality RAD electronic cigarette's offer different options, and colors to appeal to any adult audience; and, our great staff will not only explain the vaping experience but can tailor a custom vaporizer that meets your individual taste and wish list. We take the fear of the switch out of the mix. We are constantly being thanked for our help and guidance, He added.  And the e-liquid flavors are endless.  From watermelon, fire ball, coffee, pumpkin pie, and Irish Cream, to traditional tobacco flavor, RAD Vapor has everything.  According to Stern, there's something for everyone and the experienced vapor is looking for the more unique devices, or mods as they call them. "With the many devices, colors, and flavors it also becomes a fashion statement and extension of one's personality."  Vaping has existed in Europe since about 2008 and recently docked in the states.  For Stern, his mission for RAD Vapor is offering traditional tobacco cigarette smokers awareness of the vaping alternative.  The habitual sensation of inhaling an e-cigarette and blowing out a smoke-like vapor is something traditional smokers are embracing.  And the e-liquid flavors have expanded their options like they never thought possible. E-liquid blends range from 0 to 24+ pharmaceutical grade nicotine mg levels.  A traditional tobacco cigarette has about 16 mg of nicotine. An unfiltered cigarette is closer to 24 and an ultra light is closer to about 6 mg of nicotine.  The common ingredients in RAD Vapor e-liquids are water, flavorings, propylene glycol, vegetable glycerine, and nicotine.  And many are nicotine-free.  Propylene glycol and vegetable glycerine, used for e-liquid diluents, are in common food items like cake mix as well as body products and cosmetics. Both have been studied for over 40 years and considered safe by the FDA. There are no long term studies yet on vaping, but the early research has been very positive. Propylene glycol is part of the delivery system in asthma inhalers and is a byproduct of the fermentation process. Some critics quickly point out that it is in antifreeze. What critics won't tell you is that it is added to antifreeze because it is non-toxic.  So if someone drinks it they may not die from the other toxins in the antifreeze.  "So many people are converting quickly from traditional cigarettes to vapor cigarettes because they love it," Stern said. "While it mimics the experience of smoking a traditional cigarette, it's removing secondhand smoke, ash, tar, combustion, carbon monoxide and other chemicals found in tobacco."  These vaporing perks, Stern shared, remove many of the negatives to traditional smoking so people can enjoy the experience without the common complaints.  The house, car and person do not "stink" like tobacco smoke anymore. Family members, spouses and their coworkers are just as happy about the switch.   Stern said. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that secondhand vapor is non-toxic.  And when it comes to crunching numbers, vapor cigarettes saves their hard earned cash. Calculations show a traditional smoker who puffs 2 packs a day at $5 per pack is spending $10 a day. This equates to around $3,650 on cigarettes a year. Vaporizing slashes these costs – two packs a day converted to e-liquid equals about $2 per day which adds up to about $730 per year.  Imagine feeling better and saving $3000 a year. Some perks!  Stern, an entrepreneur, decided to embark on the RAD Vapor venture because for him, technology has always given humanity great devices and exceptional improvements.  A background in science, research and technology, Stern believes that RAD Vapor fits into this category.  Stern truly believes that "Vaping is a game changer in the evollution of human behavior." Continuing on to talk about how they just found nicotine in South American mummies, we breathed in smoke from fire in caves and its use is found all around the globe.  "We work hard to give all our clients options and knowledge and buyers can expect nothing less than exceptional products and service online and offline," said Stern, adding how they only sell to adults 18 years old and over.

Reuters reports that the latest data from the Federal Trade Commission showed advertising spending on cigarettes rose in 2011 to $8.4 billion, up from $8 billion in 2010. It was the first time that advertising spending rose since 2003, with the majority of that money going to promotions such as coupons, samplings and buy-two, get-one free deals.  The FTC cited data provided by major tobacco companies, including Reynolds (NYSE: RAI), Lorillard (NYSE: LO) and Richmond, Va.-based Altria Group Inc. (NYSE: MO).  The efforts are being driven by a rapid decline in smoking. Roughly 19 percent of adults in the U.S. smoked as of 2011, down from 33 percent in 1980, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Tobacco companies aren't only looking at cigarette discounts to boost their bottom lines and are placing big bets on the electronic-cigarette market and other smokeless products.  Reynolds recently announced that it will be ramping up distribution of its Vuse e-cigarette product while Lorillard’s electronic cigarettes segment — blu eCigs — continues to reap dividends for the company, with a contribution of $57 million to total net sales for the first quarter.  Altria also is planning to add a new electronic cigarette product to the mix.	bing

The signatories describe as "disappointing" a recent failure by the Assembly's health and social care committee to reach a consensus view on the idea of a ban, and state: "We want to make it clear that the provisions in this Bill relating to e-cigarettes are not evidence based".  Ms Ellison had to spill the beans when asked a direct question by Labour MP Steve McCabe.  Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellbeing at Public Health England, said: "E-cigarettes have become the most popular quitting aid in England and evidence indicates they can help smokers to give up the habit, particularly when combined with additional support".  At least 2.6 million people use e-cigarettes and nearly half are ex-smokers.  They are thought to be far healthier than smoking tobacco and are being used by many smokers to ween them off their nicotine addiction.  E-cigarettes will add to that total, with the kit costing £20 or more and replacement fluid about £10 a week.  They have been assessed as 95 per cent safer than tobacco.  Health minister Mark Drakeford has stated that e-cigarettes might act as a gateway to the uptake of smoking - and may normalise the rituals of smoking - for the young. The group said: "Other electronic cigarette manufacturers and importers should be encouraged to apply for licences too".	google

The ad on the front of the stall was removed after authorities took action in response to a Reuters investigation was published on July 18. Picture: REUTERS  New Delhi — The Indian government has threatened Philip Morris International with "punitive action" over the tobacco giant’s alleged violation of the country’s anti-smoking laws, according to a letter sent to the company by the federal health ministry.  The letter was prompted by a Reuters investigation last month that revealed how Philip Morris was deploying marketing tactics in India, some targeting young people, that officials said were illegal.  The letter cites the Reuters story in the opening paragraph, listing Philip Morris’s marketing methods as outlined in the article, including cigarette advertisements at kiosks, the free distribution of Marlboro smokes at nightclubs and bars, and the use of TV screens to promote the world’s best-selling cigarette brand at these events.  These promotional activities are a violation of the country’s tobacco control law and are subject to punishment under the act, says the letter, dated August 10.  "You are requested to clarify your position and to show cause why appropriate punitive action be not initiated against the company and its directors," the letter continues.  Such infractions can carry a fine of up to 1,000 rupees (about $15) and a sentence of up to two years in prison for the first conviction, according to the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act.  The Indian unit of Philip Morris International did not respond to questions from Reuters.  The health ministry also sent a letter to ITC, India’s leading cigarette maker, which Reuters also reported last month was using some of the same promotional methods as Philip Morris, such as point of sale displays.  In its letter to ITC, the health ministry said the company’s advertisements at kiosks were illegal.  "Advertisement other than listing type of tobacco products available, whether displayed inside or outside the shop is prohibited and attracts punishment," the ministry said.  It also called on ITC to explain why "punitive action" should not be taken against the company.  ITC did not respond to questions.  Young targets  Indian officials have repeatedly said that tobacco advertisements that use brand names, pack images or promotional messages are banned at kiosks — inside and outside.  Philip Morris and ITC have said they are in compliance with tobacco control regulations and that the law allows advertising inside a kiosk.  Philip Morris’s marketing strategy for India is laid out in hundreds of pages of internal documents that cover the period from 2009 to 2016.  A key goal, according to the documents, is "winning the hearts and minds of LA-24" — people between legal age, 18, and 24. The documents can be viewed in a searchable repository, The Philip Morris Files, published by Reuters.  The tobacco shop displays and the distribution of cigarettes at events attended by young people have helped to more than quadruple Marlboro’s market share in India, where Philip Morris is battling to win ground from ITC, which dominates the industry.  India, with a population of 1.3-billion, has about 100-million smokers. Tobacco use kills more than 900,000 people a year, according to government data.  Since October last year, the state government in India’s capital New Delhi has sent at least four letters to Philip Morris and at least three to ITC telling them to remove their advertisements at kiosks.  Indian officials say tobacco companies get away with violations of anti-smoking regulations because law enforcement is weak.  The health ministry also instructed state governments this month to move against cigarette advertising at kiosks, as well as the distribution of free cigarettes. The ministry requested that states submit a progress report on their actions.  Following the Reuters story, Delhi state tobacco control chief SK Arora said he quizzed Philip Morris about the distribution of free cigarettes.  In internal documents, Philip Morris calls distribution of free cigarettes "sampling" and says it is allowed under the law in India.  The company has spent millions of dollars promoting its Marlboro brand at social events, the documents show.  At several parties attended by Reuters reporters in Delhi over the past year, young women dressed in the colours of the latest Marlboro variant handed out free packs of cigarettes after asking people for their name, age and preferred brand.  In recent weeks, Arora said he had detected a decline in the number of cigarette ads at kiosks in Delhi.  Since the Reuters article last month, some Philip Morris ads have disappeared from several tobacco shops in Mumbai.	google

Councilwoman LaToya Cantrell, the ordinance's sponsor, said that it will likely go before the council's Community Development Committee in December. She said she also plans to hold additional public hearings to make sure that all businesses feel like they have an opportunity to voice their opinions.  Cantrell said that she hopes the ordinance will be approved no later than March 1.  Previous efforts to ban smoking have floundered, and a cadre of business interests are already lining up to fight Cantrell's proposed ban. A group calling itself the Freedom to Choose Coalition has formed to oppose her. It counts among its members the Louisiana Restaurant Association, the French Quarter Business League, the Louisiana Amusement and Music Operators Association, the Louisiana Video Gaming Association, the Louisiana Association of Wholesalers and Harrah's Casino.  Cantrell appears to have at least one vote on her side. Councilwoman Susan Guidry voiced support for a smoking ban, saying that the council was not ready to pass such a ban five years ago when she joined its ranks. Hopefully, that's changed, she said.	google										
118	adb3f20d-282b-3495-9bf5-57c764959f8b	Opinion: Education will end smoking without driving up illegal sales	Share this: SAN JOSE, CA – JULY 23: Najib Siddiqi, owner of the Berryessa Smoke Shop holds flavored tobacco products that are sold at his shop in San Jose, Calif., on Friday July 23, 2021. San Jose is considering a ban on the sale of flavored tobacco. (Anda Chu/Bay Area News Group) PUBLISHED: September 24, 2021 at 2:45 p.m. | UPDATED: September 24, 2021 at 2:45 p.m. San Jose City Council members are deliberating an ordinance that, if passed, would make flavored tobacco and menthol cigarettes illegal, even for law-abiding adults. If passed it would make those products unregulated, untaxed, sold and obtained on the underground market. If passed, it would not ban all tobacco, but those products preferred by 21+ African Americans, Latinos, and Asians. History has shown that simply banning products we don’t like nor morally align with doesn’t keep them away from youth or adults. We tried it with alcohol and saw the illegal use create one of the most dangerous crime waves in American history, resulting in countless arrests, prosecutions and death. Moreover, legal bans continue to drive profits into the hands of criminal empires, cartels, and gangs. Crime increases, yet the post-reports fail to show that usage rates decline. The violence must end. The senseless dedication to failed policy must be stemmed at the source, especially when our country is committed to reform and healing between police and communities of color. But, we find ourselves in a paradox of legalizing marijuana while outlawing and criminalizing menthols. The police don’t need one more reason to approach our young people, nor our Black men. We’ve taken a different approach with cigarettes for several decades, choosing evidence-based educational campaigns over prohibition. Those are working. Smoking is at an all-time low. Tobacco cessation and therapeutic programs continue to be the most effective pathways. We must learn from our fellow Californians in San Francisco that a ban can put San Jose in national headlines for the wrong reasons — for spurring an increase in youth smoking. As a Californian, attorney, and civil servant, I am concerned about the unintended consequences of arrests for possessing or selling menthol cigarettes by people of color if this measure were to pass. I support public health efforts, but I’ve seen too many arrests and prosecutions for minor offenses over the years. Opening the door to an unforgiving criminal justice system has had a detrimental impact on African Americans who are more likely to be wrongfully imprisoned and victims of police violence. When you ban a product preferred by communities of color, what do you think happens to that same community when police stops lead to questions like “Hey, is that a menthol? Tell me where you got it, and I’ll let you go.” They stop and threaten to arrest “suspects” for minor violations, such as jaywalking or disorderly conduct. Simply look at how many Blacks and Latinos are in the criminal justice system. What started as self-initiated stops by police then leads to other criminal justice charges and issues like mass incarceration, criminal records, or worse. Legislators are not on the front lines of enforcing the policies they enact. Police and other regulatory bodies are. Just look at the viral videos of police arrests of Blacks in Rancho Cordova, Calif., Ocean City, Md., New York City and countless others tells you the persecuted are at times also the prosecuted. I ask that the City Council reject any legislation that imposes your will on a community while blindly ignoring that the police enforcement of the prohibition cannot be “protected” with words. You will create another point of contact with law enforcement – one that could be negative, harmful, perpetuate criminal justice issues and imprisonment, or worse. How do you end smoking without driving up illegal sales? With education and cessation programs, not a prohibition.

119	11240a63-a329-3ed4-8bd8-31eda23d0a25	How to talk to your kids about vaping	Nicole Villalpando, Austin American-Statesman Tuesday Sep 24, 2019 at 12:52 PM Recently you’ve been hearing and reading reports about illnesses and deaths linked to using e-cigarettes or vaping. Last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released these figures: There have been 530 cases of lung injury reported in 38 states and 1 U.S. territory. Seven deaths have been attributed to this in six states. Doctors locally are starting to see patients going to the emergency room because of lung injuries after vaping. Sometimes, these patients are coming in with symptoms that can be confused with something like pneumonia, but the symptoms also include things that wouldn’t be pneumonia. Symptoms include cough, headache, fatigue and chills but also nausea and vomiting. Some of the challenge is that we’re not really sure whether it’s the substance in the e-cigarette itself or whether it’s the act of inhaling a vapor into the lungs or both. E-cigarettes can have all kinds of things in them from nicotine to THC (the chemical in marijuana that gets you high). They also can have just flavorings or something as dangerous and unexpected as formaldehyde. “It’s really hard to know what each one has, and how they really impact our bodies,” says Dr. Kavita Patel, a pediatric pulmonologist at Texas Children’s Hospital Speciality Care Austin. Patel also worries about teens and preteens using substances like nicotine and THC because they are highly addictive and this is a time when teens’ brains are still being shaped. “The other substances, we don’t know enough about it,” says Dr. Mai Duong, chief of pediatrics at Austin Regional Clinic. “Even the flavorings are harmful,” Patel says. The act of vaping means that very tiny particles are getting into the smallest spaces of the lungs, potentially deeper than where cigarette smoke reaches, Patel says. Vaping was marketed as a safer alternative to cigarettes, but that’s not proving to be true, says Patel says. With people showing up in the emergency room and even dying, “It’s a really scary time,” Patel says. Parents can be on the lookout for some signs that their kids are vaping. Who are their friends? Are their friends vaping? Do you go into their room and smell something sweet? Do you see something that looks like a pen or a flash drive or a lipstick or an asthma inhaler that you don’t recognize? The tough thing with vaping is that it’s easier to hide than cigarettes and marijuana use, Patel says. Duong is now talking to her teen patients about the use of alcohol, tobacco and drug use as she always has, but now, she says, she’s focusing a little more on talking about vaping. Parents should talk to their kids about vaping and it’s not a one-time conversation. “It’s more effective if it comes up organically,” Duong says. If you drive by a vape shop or see someone vaping, that’s perfect time to talk about it. Family dinners also could be an opportunity for conversation. Instead of lecturing, Duong suggests asking open-ended questions, being nonjudgmental and not lecturing. Duong warns against trying to scare kids. For example, if you say “it could kill you,” and then they try it a few times and it doesn’t kill them, well, what you said wasn’t true in that instance. “Stick with the facts,” she says. Talk about potential harm. Talk about the reality that they might not know what they are inhaling, and it might not be just the substance in the cartridge. “People are stealing embalming fluid from the mortuary,” Duong says. “You really don’t know what’s in it.” Duong also recommends these tips to be ready to talk to kids: Study Up. Start by learning more about vaping, types of e-cigarettes and the associated risks. Learn the language, too, to see if words like “juuling” or “juicing” pop up in your teen’s conversations. Make time to talk. The sooner you start talking, the better — with an emphasis on the word “start.” Don’t view this discussion as a one-time occurrence. Bring up the topic again afterward and often, as you see or hear new developments on the topic. Listen, don’t lecture. Hear your teen’s perspective. See what they already know — or believe is true. Foster discussion with succinct comments and a lot of give and take. Try starting with an open-ended question such as, “What do you think about vaping?” Stick to facts. Just saying “vaping is bad for you” usually isn’t effective. During your research, accumulate data, experts’ evidence-based conclusions and how it makes sense to abstain. Teach them how to say no. When they are offered opportunities to vape, do they know how to respond? Practice with them. Pretend you’re a classmate offering them an e-cigarette. Try to come up with several responses. Acknowledge your limits. You know you can’t monitor them all the time. Why not make them feel empowered in a positive way? Consider saying something like, “You need to decide for yourself.” Be an example. If you use tobacco products, it is not too late to quit.

120	356f0bb0-41bd-3ff8-9bc3-4a192b50a802	The Smoke and Mirrors of Tobacco Regulations	Tobacco control policy has been in what feels like a near-constant state of change for the past two decades. And this isn’t likely to resolve anytime soon.  With the release of long-awaited new rules from the Food and Drug Administration on Thursday, the agency decreed that electronic nicotine delivery devices (including electronic cigarettes), cigars, hookah, pipe tobacco and roll-your-own tobacco are tobacco products that fall under its regulatory authority. Essentially, these other tobacco products will be subject to many of the same rules as cigarettes and smokeless tobacco, products that the FDA has been regulating since 2009.  The new regulations include restricting teen access, mandating ingredient disclosure, subjecting products to review (including those already on the market), taking enforcement action on false claims made on products (such as claiming a product poses no harm) and requiring warning labels.  Try Newsweek for only $1.25 per week  Some of these regulations, such as restricting teen access, will be enacted within a few months. Others, like FDA review of tobacco products both new and old, will take years.  Public health advocates are lauding the FDA’s new rules as a critically important step in reducing the harms associated with tobacco use. Some in the electronic cigarette or vaping industry are lamenting that the regulations are overly restrictive and damaging to their industry, a $3 billion-a-year business.  However, before casting judgment on what is officially being called the FDA “final rule,” it’s important to note that some issues are still in play. The “final rule” may not be all that final.  The new rules leave several potential regulatory actions for consideration at some future time. For example, although flavored cigarettes are banned, the new rules leave other flavored tobacco products, like bubblegum-flavored liquid for electronic cigarettes and berry-flavored cigars, untouched. Research has shown that flavored products may be particularly appealing to teens.  Potential legal action by the tobacco industry and/or by vaping manufacturers could delay or prevent certain regulatory provisions from ever being enacted. The industry has a long history of litigating tobacco policy.  For example, even though the introduction of new graphic-warning labels (as opposed to the long-standing text-only warning labels) were a cornerstone of the 2009 Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, the tobacco industry successfully sued the FDA and prevented the introduction of the labels on cigarette packages.  In addition, the House Appropriations Committee passed a bill in mid-April that, if passed into law, would effectively shield thousands of electronic cigarette products already on the market from FDA review.  Finally, research activity that is critical to informing FDA tobacco regulations has grown substantially in the past several years. As the evidence base continues to grow, additional regulatory actions or modifications to existing regulations may be needed.  For example, although the evidence is currently mixed, research may eventually demonstrate that some electronic nicotine-delivery devices help people quit smoking cigarettes. If that happens, regulations would need to accommodate these new findings.  Comfort can be taken in the fact that the FDA is moving forward to protect the public from the harms of tobacco, and that overall tobacco control policy is progressing rather than regressing. But don’t get too comfortable with the regulations as they are currently proposed. There are too many ways for them to change.  William G.

Botox at the corners of the mouth. There was this lady doctor who "discovered" that her patients who got the botox treatment reduced significantly or quit all together smoking. Obviosly, this is a side effect of the treatment. As far as I understand, for about 3 months after botox, your mouth is semi-paralyzed. The idea was that people weren't able to whistle, to suck through a straw or to smoke.She was careful to say that the procedure isn't FDA approved as a quit smoking remedy. Delay the First Cig of the Day I've given up smoking many times - I used Alan Carr's books very successfully, stopping first for 3 months (1989) then 3 years (1996 - 9), but went back on...it's a strong addiction! Then, using much of the same mental processing"you're killing yourself to make someone else rich?! " I did a cold turkey job (2005 - 2015) which meant not going out, not being around my smoking friends or smoking places for a month, running every day, and just sticking to that. After 6 weeks my smoking cough had gone and I could breathe more easily. But....7 years later, 2012, and I'm working with a lot of smokers and for some reason started smoking shisha - using molasses rather than tobacco but it gave me a bit of a hit, so I got back into smoking through the back door, as it were. Two years of a daily shisha and then I'm on holiday with smokers, 2015, and just started joining in with the odd cigarette - this is what pulled me right back in. It's a funny thing that after that holiday I could go for a week without but I knew I'd be meeting a smoking friend every Friday for a while and would 'blag' a fag off them. I'd spend the rest of the week 'waiting' for the next hit. So I ended up buying my own tobacco and you can guess I got back into it. However, it wasn't as full-blown as formerly - so I'd have up to 5 fags a day, and even fewer on other days. Still, I tried stopping after a year of this and couldn't so I realised that it was a thing for me. Another year passed and I just decided that the smokers cough was untenable and I had to stop. So this was how I did it. I had a couple of tiny cigars, a few cigarettes and about 1/4 bag of rolling tobacco. I decided that I would eke these out but buy no more afterwards. I set a date and a protocol - to delay the first smoke of the day for an hour every day - beginning at 9.0 am on day 1,10 on day 2,11 on day 3 etc. I had an electronic cigarette for 'emergencies', and I was 'allowed' to use this whenever I wanted, although, as it turned out, I didn't use it very much, it was just good to have it there 'in case'. I was also allowed to smoke as much as I liked after the start time, although I was mindful that I only had so much tobacco so couldn't go crazy. Well the cravings were quite mad - especially when I'd be waiting til 11,12,1 or 2 to smoke - those were the hard days of really doing battle with the addiction - mental madness (! ) and I just had to fill my time - I got SO much done! Cleaning, cooking, walking, all the work that had been waiting for me to get around to it...anyway by the 8 pm start I was suddenly 'off' the flavour of cigarettes - yuk, the last couple of cigarettes were SO DISGUSTING it was as much as I could do to finish them - I did finish them just to teach myself how awful they were. I kept the last one in a jar (a la Alan Carr) and then had a little funeral of my smoking paraphernalia. Smoking is a mental thing as well as physical, and it acts as a kind of 'friend' - so my 'funeral' was to acknowledge all the good things about it - a little obituary for the friendships I'd made through chatting with smokers, blagging lights, the support it had given me when I'd reached for it when things weren't going well etc etc. I think it is important to acknowledge that smoking is a multi-dimensional thing, it has associations and 'meanings' - like we probably all started smoking to be cool with our peers, or to rebel a bit, and with hindsight we wish we had chosen another route, but in my funeral I was just tipping my hat to the past, the fun I had and the trouble it got me into. So now I can happily say that I have completed my smoking journey - I haven't had many cravings since the 'funeral' - I use the e-cig if I'm with other smokers (and as they are a dying breed, this isn't very often). However, maybe its because I'm getting older now, this time I had an unexpected side effect of constipation. Apparently, when we stop smoking we stop swallowing so much mucus and the bowel dries out a bit. This has taken me on another healing journey, and I am so grateful to Earth Clinic for all the information about this, that has helped me get onto a healthy path again. The garlic is best if you can get organic, but I used mostly the chinese from the supermarket and the cayenne from the spice isle, three cloves crushed and left for ten minutes, and the cayenne mixed with butter on bread every day! , then make a sandwich of what you fancy... Youll find if the cayenne is mixed with butter it takes the sting out of it, mix it like a paste. It goes down well with egg yolk in a fried egg.... Otherwise its too hot. You will get your wind back fairly quickly with the cayenne, but over a few weeks the garlic will float the muck off the lungs. About a quarter of a teaspoon of cayenne everyday. Or if you are really breathless take more it works very fast in dilating the small blood vessels and getting the oxygen around. It enhances the effect of garlic in cleaning out the lungs. Dried Ginseng Posted by Alfred (Bangkok, Thailand) on 04/01/2010 I have never smoked.. but over the years smoking bothered me.. I did a lot of looking.. how to stop smoking.. I came across the following.. Its not difficult to do and not expensive.. I think worth a try.. Dried Ginseng..take small piece, chew.. swallow the juice, and swallow the Ginseng piece when it gets too small to chew... The article said.. NO withdrawal pain.. My opinion.. Ginseng is healthy.. can not hurt.. But maybe will work..Good luck.. Eat Apples and Oranges Hi guys. About six and a half years ago I quit smoking in a very short period of time. Prior to this I had been trying off and on to do the same with the regular methods, but it never did work for me. What happened was while working my overnight job I was looking to increase energy by eating apples and oranges during my very strict two fifteen minute breaks. I also had to try and smoke a cigarette of course. I ate the fruit first and then tried to smoke; disgusting! I couldn't handle the taste and could only get through a very little bit of that cigarette. The taste stuck with me and I found myself smoking less and less over the next couple of days and then, no more. I don't know if there was anything else going on there, but that's all I remember doing at the time. So I don't know if this would actually work for anyone else, but I thought it was worth mentioning. I am curious to see if anyone else gives this a try though. This also worked for me! The taste of the orange left in the mouth made the taste of the cigarette so disgusting there was no pleasure at all in it. It took about a week as I could cheat and simply smoke after eating other food, so I had to make sure and eat oranges after meals etc, it does work! Ellis' Quit Smoking Technique Ted makes some really good points here. As someone who smoked a pack a day for 9 years, and who quit many times before quitting for good, 10 years ago, I have a lot of first-hand experience with quitting smoking. In my experience, the first three days are the hardest. That is when I would feel like I was alternately going insane and/or becoming enlightened. There is a kind of buzzing in the head coupled with increasing energy which can easily turn to anxiety and agitation. The pull to smoke doesn't end after 3 days though. My experience was that the longing to reach for a cigarette when feeling stressed out, or at the end of the work-day, or with a drink, etc, SLOWLY melted away over the course of a year until the urges were pretty rare. Even these rare urges slowly became even less frequent as the years went by. It was like breaking up with someone. It takes time. Even 10 years later I still occassionally get a sudden craving for a cigarette. Maybe 3 times a year and it's not very strong. Along with Ted's recomendations for the body, I have a recomendation for the mind (and the mind is definetely involved with this.) This is a technique which worked really well for me. It is ingenious and very effective if you have a sincere desire to quit. It was given to me by a friend who had also used it to quit smoking after 40 something years. The technique: 1. Determine how many ciggarettes you smoke per day. [for me it was 20]2. Determine how long you want to take to quit smoking. It could be a week, a month, or any number you want. It's your choice. [I chose 20 days]3. You are going to reduce the number of cigarettes you smoke by 1 every -blank- number of days. Choose what that -blank- number of days is. [I chose to reduce the number of cigarettes I smoked by one, every -1- days. For example: the first day I smoked 20, the next day I smoked 19, on the third day I smoke 18, etc. You could choose to reduce the cigarettes by one every day, every 2 days, every week, or whatever you want. It's totally your choice.]4. Buy a small pad of paper that is comfortable to carry with you wherever you go that you smoke.5. Every single time you are about to smoke one of your cigarettes, first take a moment to write down in your pad of paper whatever you are feeling and doing at that exact moment. [What your feeling could be anything such as, "I'm feeling excited, happy, sad, stressed, angry, bored, hungry, frustrated, etc." It could even be, "I'm feeling nothing." What you're doing could be anything, such as I'm at work, just had an argument, watching tv, stuck in traffic, at a party, having coffee, just finished dinner, etc.]6. Lastly, you buy the same amount of cigarettes that you used to buy before you started this technique, and you destroy the extra cigarettes that you are not smoking and throw them in the trash. [Because I smoked a pack a day when I started this process, I had to buy a brand new pack every day, even though I was gradually reducing the number I would smoke out of that pack by one every day. For instance, on day 15, near the end of the process, I had to buy a new pack, I smoked 5 of them, and then I crumbled up the remaining 15 and threw them away. On day 16 I bought a new pack, smoked 4 of them, crumbled up the remaining 16 and threw them away, etc. This practice is to drive it home to you how much money you spend on cigarettes.] If you follow this program like I did, you will be completely ready to quit by the last day. For me, I was dying to quit by the last week. In fact, I couldn't even wait, and I stopped a few days before the end with no problems. I have been off them ever since. Remember, once you're off them, don't ever, EVER take even a single puff off of someone elses cigarette for the rest of you life. If you take even one puff, you will eventually start smoking again and will go back to ruining your own good health. Good luck! You can do it! No you cannot do this when you are trying to save money. You just take the new pack and spread it out over a longer period of time. You are "weaning" yourself off them in a more controlled method. Save your old empty packs and split one pack up into groups of 6,8 or 10 cigarettes. Do this with every new pack until you can quit for good. When you are trying to quit, never buy them by the carton. You are retraining your brain to be satisfied with a few which leads to none. hey there jc, , , I'm really really happy that you found something that weaned you off smoking as it is such a destructive and terrible habit and addiction that I suffer from as I type, , i have read so many different posts on how to stop and i'm sure there are many peeps out there that have tried different methods to no avail, , but I also know of people (close friends) that smoked far more than I do that have just decided to give it up and that was that, , , they haven't smoked since that day, , , i almost did, , , as I been telling myself daily that I should stop, , , so I kinda cut down, , , some days would really smoke less than others and about a week ago I only had 1 ciggy the whole day, , , , but that was for that day only, , , , and now i'm smoking about 10 This is the ideal way to quit - I smoked for 11 years & tapered off the way he described --although instead of destroying the ciggs not smoked I would put that cash saved in a jar and then buy something special --the reason I am writing is after not smoking for 20 years -for some reason I decided to start again BIG mistake although I am smoking only about 6 a day for the last 3 years -quitting is just as difficult --& I must say 20 years ago after I quit I always Missed it and if I saw someone smoking I still wanted to have one -- For me that feeling never went away -- so if you are successful -don't be temped to have one! I always smoked mainly with a friend, so at times I would go months and was fine. Of course that changed, and I started smoking more regularly, plus enjoying my wine at the same time. I have severe mercury toxicity and have had the teeth all taken care of by a biological dentist. But all this has settled in my brain and other places and my immune system is rock bottom (though miraculously) I never get sick. but my mind is bad, very emotional, scared.... and in pain (which moves from place to place) from the moment I open my eyes. SO in the evenings the one thing that for some reason stops the pain is wine, and with wine comes the smokes. I KNOW I need to stop and I CAN go a day or so without it, but I do not have the will power or I talk myself out of it, and may only have 3-4 cigarettes. which is STILL not good. Then I beat myself up because my spouse I know wants me to stop, and we know that the smoke smell is always on us. I just need some support with this AND just getting through this detox that is going way way too slow. Lots of people, including me 11 years ago, have had great success (with absolutely NO desire to smoke again!) reading the book "The Easy Way to Stop Smoking", by Allen Carr. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO STOP COLD-TURKEY! Here's a synopsis from Amazon: "Allen Carr's innovative Easyway method—which he discovered after his own 100-cigarette-a-day habit nearly drove him to despair—has helped millions kick smoking without feeling anxious and deprived. That's because he helps smokers discover the psychological reasons behind their dependency, explains in detail how to handle the withdrawal symptoms, shows them how to avoid situations when temptation might become too strong, and enables them to stay smoke-free. Carr discusses such issues as nicotine addiction; the social “brainwashing” that encourages smoking; the false belief that a cigarette relieves stress; the role boredom plays in sabotaging efforts to stop; and the main reasons for failure. With this proven program, smokers will be throwing away their packs for good." My Husband started smoking at about 13 (not much) when his parents where not home..then he would also go to there bar in the house and have a drink! They never knew..When he was about 19teen he was smoking 2 1/2 packs of Lucky Strikes, or Camels aday.. I'm not a drinker, and smoked a bit as a teenager cause it was cool at the time lol. When my husband was 38 he went out with a friend, and came home about 11pm, and was drunk, and had a black out, which dumb me didnt know what that was..About two on the morning when he was Ok, I said, thats it.. when you come home from work, go to a AA meeting or pack your stuff and get out of this house. We had two children, I was a stay at home Mom. When he got home from the office, we both went to a Huge AA meeting, must of been close to at least 500 people there All smoking, and allot had been drinking. It was a scary meeting..After, When we got to the parking lot, I said, what do you think? He said I will Never Drink or smoke again..As he now says, I did both about acouple of times, and one of the drinking times he had a car accident..didnt get hurt, but the car was bad. Now I'm jumping 10 yrs later after he stopped smoking, my husband was then 47, and he goes to a cardiologist on a wed. as I knew there was something wrong..Btw he is a slim man, that is althletic. The first question the Dr.asked was, Do You Smoke? No, not in about 10ys. He did awful on the heart tests. Two days later on Friday, he was at Cedar Sinai hospital, and the Dr. Got a team together, on Monday he had a Quadruple heart By-Pass surgery. If he did not have the surgery the Drs. Said he would have had a heart attack within two weeks and would have never survived..Just want to mention we have a few Dr. Friends, and if we didnt he would not have got to a good Cardio Dr. In a day..Its awful to say, but it makes a big difference, or my husband would have died. Btw, cause we are slim we thought we could eat what ever we wanted, and he could smoke with no problem, No that is not true. After that we totally changed our diet, and still do. My husband is now 76, of course he does not smoke or drink, but he did have a slight heart attack last year, and did survive.. we are still very active, but if you think its ok to just smoke 7 to 10 cigarettes, you are in Denial. You cannot...my husbands friend thought it was ok to smoke 8 aday. He dropped dead at 47 yrs, and left two boys in high school, and 3 little girls under 5... It's So selfish of anyone to do that to your family and think it can't happen to me. It does Not matter how much money you have, or don't, cigarettes will Kill you, or Ruin your life . if its Not Cancer, it Will be Your Heart Arteries, or your Lungs with COPD...Do NOT Let Cigarettes Control Your Life. Stand up and be Strong. Stop your little game with cigarettes. Just Stop making Stupid Excuses that you can't Stop.. Just Stop or get the Patch. Ginger Root Nothing worked for me until I ran across something by accident. I'd found that ginger helped cure my dog's lymphatic leukemia and works on many other cancers as well. My family has an extensive history of cancer to I started taking it myself as a preventative measure. Since then I've noticed many other benefits from it and researching it on the net confirmed it was the ginger responsible for several of those benefits. Among those benefits was a massive decrease in the urge to smoke. It turns out that ginger contains niacin which flushes nicotine out of the body. Nicotine is the addictive ingredient in tobacco. Obtaining the niacin with fresh ginger seems to be more effective than supplments but that's just my own opinion. The only problem is that ginger is also a stimulant and will keep you up nights so don't take it if you're planning on going to sleep in 4 hours or so. Hi Scott, glad you healed your dog and yourself. My dad has “terminal cancer”. When I first saw him, he was already on his way out.. To the other side. His skin was grey, he had not eaten in over a week, he was not as coherent, he was barely able to walk and he was in a lot of pain. I loaded him up with FlorEssence (Liquid), Plant-based protein powder, Organic Greens Powder, Organic Liquid Vitamins, the best Pro-Biotic capsules, Organic Aloe Vera Juice, L-Glutamine, Immune Something to boost his White Blood Count and T-Cells, Turmeric Tincture. And in four days, he was eating one meal a day, his skin had color again, he was walking faster, and he was much more coherent. However, his pain is increasing daily. And he is still smoking and drinking (beer) during that time and was still improving. He saw a doctor yesterday and he has a tumor between his spine and his left shoulder blade. He has another appointment to do more tests. I believe they talked to him about possible radiation or chemo (I have to get the complete story from my brother who is caring for him) to his area that is ailing him. I believe I can cure him but not sure if he does not stop smoking and drinking. He says he hasn't stopped because the doctors have not told him to stop. However, he does want to stop. Please share your method of taking ginger root, are you chewing on it to help you stop smoking or making tea? Thank you. Concerning the nicotine addiction, there was a guy in Texas that ran a home for Girls and many came with various addictions. He'd put them through a three day watermelon cleanse... Like eat a watermelon a day and the liquid would get to the cellular level and virtually all the girls broke their addictions doing this cleanse. (He was Lester Rolof.) Sorry it's taken me so long to respond you you but I don't usually re-read my posts. I'd get it in the supermarket or farmer's market fresh and cut off a slice 2-3 times a day and eat it raw. I usually have to wash it down with a bit of water. I believe raw is better than the dried form in capsules. Just my opinion. This really is a miracle food. I keep finding more things it does for you. It's an anti bacterial, viral and fungal, anti-inflammatory ( I rarely feel any joint pain any more), diarrhea, helps with most cancers, diabetes, reduces blood pressure, gallbladder stones and more. I still take it every day at least once a day but shoot for twice, just not too late as it will keep you up. The other day I was coming down with a cold. I took the ginger along with zinc and calcium in a 2:1 ration with magnesium and vitamin d. The zinc interferes with the cold virus binding to cells. As for the calcium, allegedly most viruses and bacteria need a more acid environment in which to survive. The calcium makes your body more alkaline. I only took two doses of this and forgot after that. Last night I'd realized I'd forgotten but it didn't matter because after the 1st dose I didn't feel the cold any more anyway. My boss had a terrible cold by the time I'd found out about it. I told him about this and 2 days later his cold was completely gone. Then I get my cold a few days later. I can't blame it on him because I work from home and the only was I communicate with him is via the internet and phone, lol. I've never even seen the guy. Anyway, as far as I'm concerned, ginger is a miracle food everyone should take every day. Horsetail Extract Horsetail extract contains silica complex which is a sure shot method of quitting smoking. It's incredible that almost no one really knows about this simple supplement which is a book for smokers worldwide. I have many acquaintances who have quit taking by simply taking silica complex tablets. I am not sure if this is the right forum for this since this is a health site but this is what worked for me, I had multiple addictions and used to smoke two packs a day- I had success with hypnotherapy, it gets to the root cause of why we smoke. then- keeping track of the money saved. (14$ a day, 98$ a week) and taking some of that and treating myself to something nice ( a pedicure, movie ) at the end of the week if I didn't smoke. the amount of money saved each week was extremely motivating! Good luck to all! Quitting smoking is so hard and you all deserve good health! Licorice Root Extract First, nicotine is in no way addicting, contrary to the patch and gum commercials. I've taken the nicotine lozenges, and had no problem quitting them immediately. In my opinion, there are at least two reasons for smoking. One is when you start in High School, or whenever young. That one is easier to quit, because you started to imitate others, or someone started you, not for your own reasons. The second kind is when you are older usually. This cause of smoking is for self treatment because you have some kind of pain, anguish or other psychological problem. With that kind, you won't quit until your problem goes away. But some relief can come by using licorice root extract, without the drug being taken out, as in de-glycerized, DGL, products. The drug in it removes the desire to smoke, from the very first day. So plan on using it when you are ready to quit smoking. The only side effect can be blurry vision. Don't take it before bedtime as it can keep you awake. Lobelia I have recently stopped smoking with the aid of Lobelia and found its effects amazing to say the least. I have smoked for 25 years and have tried every quit method you know, more than once, some worked and some didn't, but none have worked quite like Lobelia. I started taking the tincture 4 days or so prior to my stop date (3 drops x 5 times daily) and today - day 8, I've used the drops once. I actually feel like I was never a smoker, perhaps it's the right time for me this time but it certainly has been far easier than I imagined. No cravings whatsoever and I really feel that I am thru the worst and its smooth sailing from here ? without any fears! The herbs are easy to obtain from a naturopath. If you've wanted to quit but fear has held you back I highly recommend this herb. Thank you Jesus for Lobelia.This wonderful herb can help you quit smoking . I take 3-10 drops 3 times daily or when I feel the urge to smoke or before I eat a meal. Its works quickly. There is a slight burning in the back of the throat but soon after the urge to smoke is gone and if you do smoke it tastes horrible.This remedy works because lobelia contains the active ingredient lobeline, which is almost identical to nicotine and has similar effects on the nervous system. A bottle costs around $15.00 in most Canadian health food stores. Try it you might like it. First of all I didnt think Lobelia was going to actually work there was too many "to good to be true" reviews on it. But at $5 a bottle and 100 pills in that bottle I couldnt pass up at least giving it a go. When I first started to take it I was surprised to find that it does reduce cravings and makes your cigarettes taste a bit funky. Honestly its wasn't so much of a funky taste to me that I would of put out and wasted a cigarette. OH and it did help me breathe better. I started smoking at 18 and after 10 years of it I cant remember the last time I could take such a deep breath. Anywho I had a cigarette filter from a previous quit smoking attempt-the last step in the filters I never got to. BTW this filter supposedly it cuts out 90% of the nicotine. So I started using it along with taking the lobelia and my cravings reduce even more. Now let us not forget the obvious that commitment and willpower is also involved. I promised myself that A) I wouldn't buy anymore packs during this period and B) THE last cigarette would be my last. ALL IN ALL: I started taking the lobelia on Aug 4th probably started using the filter two or three days later and on Aug 9th I had my last cigarette. I went from smoking about a pack that first day (smoked over a pack a day before this) to only having 5 smokes the last day. Today is Aug 23rd and its my second week of being free of my angry hungry big little nicotine monster. I have my moments of "I need an effing smoke" especially after eating or just sitting there being bored. Its a mental want and not a physical want I just take a few deep breaths (now that I can) and it passes by quickly. and I know its really early to get too excited about but... Im very happy to be smoke free and dont ever again want to give in to the monster. Gosh! I just paid $14 for tiny bottle of spray. Where did you get it for $5???? Also, I've never heard of these cigarette filters . Where can I find them? One last question....Did the Liberia have any bad side effects. I'm prone to diarrhea when I consume something odd. I really want to kick this nasty habit. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. God bless. Multiple Remedies I want to share this cheap & quick step-down method that made it VERY easy to get cigarettes & nicotine out of my life.. YEA!! (I see similar points noted but not combined as here to work) 1) Natural Tobacco= First I started rolling my own cigs 3-4 months before my desired "quit" time. STOP USING store bought cigs ASAP! Jan 2012 the papers, filters & tobacco averaged $1. 50 a pack. Use "smooth" or "ribbon" cut pipe tobacco (not cigarette tobacco) and select a "mild" mix. Now you are rid of the 2, 000 additives cigs have AND only dealing with the "natural" leaf nicotine! Also my dislike of the "rolling" hassle made me "think" with each cig.. Do I really need it? or just smoke half? 2) Vinegar= then BEST OF ALL, I stumbled onto the "hidden" patent info about adding a drop or 2 of plain white vinegar to the cigarette filter neutralizes the nicotine. You cant smell or taste the vinegar once dry. I did this to every cig for the last 4-6 weeks before I quit. Couple weeks with 1 drop.. Then next couple with 2. (this seems to be the other poster's nicotine blocker). 3) Diet changes= I got serious about taking a good all around vitamin plus a super B complex.. Also doubled my water & fresh fruit intake. I ate more healthy foods and stopped skipping meals (nic kills your appetite & taste). I can tell the super B's really do help with nic cravings. Yeah Ted! 4) Mental Facts= With every thought of "I want a cig", I remind myself that I REALLY DON'T.. Its just the top used insecticide poison thats talking. Being already SUPER addictive and unbelieveably chemically multiplied & enhanced in cigs to addict me even further, its no wonder that it screams at me. Nicotine only provides me illness and death. Am I that easy a target? No, I truly DON"T WANT a cig.. I WANT the NICOTINE.. Or DO I?? 5) E-cig backup= I bought an e-cig with both "light nicotine" & "zero nicotine/water" cartridges. I used the "light nic" when I was cutting down and ran out of self rolled cigs. After my quitting, there have been just a couple times I wanted to "smoke" (when smoking friend visits) so I just puffed my water vapor ecig and laughed at myself. 6) A New Dance= I felt ready and just stopped smoking one day after all the above.. But I needed one last step. I've had almost zero "physical" craves, but mental triggers were in everything I do daily. To deal with triggers, as soon as I think cig, I quickly step away from that situation.. Then I return, performing it differently and repeat to make a new habit of that situation without a cig. I am quickly remembering doing it the new way & forgetting the old. (like holding phone in other hand). I have only been quit a month but already cigs seem like a faint memory.. I go all day without thinking of one unless I cross an old trigger I havent "un-done".. And even then its not a fever wish, but just a thought that its "time" for a cig.. Well, I know its not and so I dance a new step into that situation and now enjoy "breathing" past it.. Combining all these helps made the cravings sooo weak that I easily walked away. I hope you do too! ;)	rss

House Bill (HB) 6317, filed on June 5 and forwarded to the committee a day after, aims to amend Republic Act (RA) 8240 or the National Internal Revenue Code. RA 8240 currently allots 15% of the revenues collected from excise tax on tobacco products for a fund to be used only for programs of farmers. The fund is shared among burley and native-tobacco producing provinces. The said fund shall only be used on cooperative projects improving the quality of agricultural products and raising the income of farmers as well as livelihood projects specifically the "development of alternative farming," the law states. It shall also be used on agro-industrial projects enabling farmers to own post-harvest projects and secondary processing projects such as cigarette manufacturing. If HB 6317 is passed in the last stretch of the 15th Congress, farmers will also benefit from infrastructure projects such as farm-to-market roads and bridges. The measure was authored by La Union Reps. Victor F. Ortega (1st district) and Eufranio C. Eriguel (2nd district), whose constituents are farmers of Virginia, burley and native types of tobacco, based on the data from the National Tobacco Administration’s Web site. Other growers of burley tobacco are Pangasinan, Abra, Isabela, Cagayan, Tarlac, and Occidental Mindoro. Cagayan, Isabela, Nueva, Nueva Vizcaya, Quirino, Capiz, Iloilo, Cebu, Negros Oriental, Leyte, Zamboanga del Sur, Bukidnon, Misamis Oriental, North Cotabato, and Maguindanao are growers of native tobacco. In the bill’s explanatory note, the lawmakers said that the Joint Circular 2009-1 implementing section 8 of RA 8240 impedes the development of infrastructure projects for farmers. The joint circular was penned by the Department of Budget and Management (DBM), the National Tobacco Administration, and the Bureau of Internal Revenue. "The DBM now is of opinion that the enumeration under section 8 of RA 8240 as implemented by [the joint circular] is exclusive, thereby disallowing projects now specifically mentioned such as infrastructure projectsâ€¦" the solons stated. The legislators argued that the projects provided in RA 7171, "An Act to Promote the Development of the Farmers in the Virginia Tobacco, should be the same with RA 8240. "It is our view that section 8 of RA 8240 should have been interpreted relative to RA 7171 as intended by the lawmakers who crafted [it]. This is the reason why the objectives of RA 8240â€¦ are similar to those of RA 7171â€¦ which provides that 15% of tax proceeds from locally manufactured Virginia-type of cigarettes (sic) shall be used for four different types of projects including â€˜[d] infrastructure projects such as farm-to-market roads.’ Why should the proceeds from burley and native tobacco be any different?" Last month, HB 5727, the "sin" tax reform bill, was passed in the House of Representatives. The measure, certified as urgent by the President, will impose higher excise taxes and set two tiers for tobacco products, wines and fermented liquors and three tiers for distilled spirits, all pegged on these products’ net retail prices. Revenues that will be generated from the change in excise taxes are earmarked for the administration’s universal health care program and for the benefit of farmers. Meanwhile, the Senate has yet to pass their version of the sin tax reform bill. Three measures restructuring excise taxes of tobacco and alcohol products -- Senate Bills (SB) 2763 and 2764 by Sen. Panfilo M. Lacson and SB 2998 by Sen. Miriam Defensor-Santiago -- are still pending in the Senate Committee on Ways and Means chaired by Sen. Ralph G. Recto since last year. -- Monica Joy O.

(Associated Press) - The University of Southern Mississippi is getting ready to ban all forms of tobacco on campus.  Starting Jan. 1, no cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos, pipes, e-cigarettes, smokeless tobacco or products that mimic tobacco will be allowed.  Southern Miss was one of eight colleges and universities in the state to recently receive a grant from the CVS Health Foundation to become tobacco-free campuses. Spokesman Jim Coll says the $20,000 grant will go toward installation of tobacco-free signs, education efforts and the promotion of cessation resources at Southern Miss.  The University of Mississippi banned all tobacco products in 2013, and Mississippi State went tobacco-free in 2016.

GhanaPa calls on the government through the FDA to stand firm and resolute on its position to not allow celebrities to advertise on alcoholic beverages in Ghana. In a press release issued in Accra on Wednesday and signed by the Alliance's National Coordinator, Mr. Abdul Fatah Adam calls on FDA to stand firm despite the attacks and condemnations from celebrities and a cross-section of media organisations in the country. Some celebrities condemned the FDA for banning them from advertising for alcoholic entities claiming it has deprived them of some livelihood. The press statement noted that the decision to ban known personalities from alcoholic advertisement is to basically prevent children and youth from exposure to alcoholic harm which has a lot of negative health consequences on their development. "We will continue to sensitize the public on the harmful effects of alcohol and the reasons for the ban," the statement said. Alcohol, according to the statement affects every facet of human development from health, environment, economy, society, family amongst others. The press released further advised Ghanaian celebrities to keep in mind that there is conflict between the interest of the alcoholic industry and those of the public health and by extension the rights of the Ghanaian child. A lot of young people are currently dying due to excessive alcohol accessibility and affordability of alcohol beverages which are sold virtually at every corner nationwide. The press release revealed that over three million persons lost their lives yearly due to alcohol which is also responsible for over 200 diseases and health conditions such as diabetes, liver cancers as well as infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, HIV, pneumonia amongst others. "We continue to commend the FDA for being resolute in protecting Ghanaian children and our future generations from the harm and dangers of alcohol," the statement added. In as much as GhanaPa salutes celebrities who have boldly stated their position to stand firm with us, we shall as a Civil Society Organization resist any attempt by others who aimed at nothing but their selfish interests which has the potency to jeopardize the foundation of the Ghanaian child, the statement concluded.	rss

Congress welcomes e-cigarette ban, says decision taken to appease US The Congress party on Wednesday welcomed the Centre's decision to ban e-cigarettes but claimed the decision was taken to appease the United States. Asking if the government will prohibit the production and use of traditional cigarettes containing tobacco, Congress spokesperson Ajay Maken said: "The ban on electronic cigarettes is a good decision. We welcome it." "But we would like to ask the government whether they ban other cigarettes and Pan Masala? If e-cigarettes can be banned, why cannot other cigarettes and Pan Masala be banned," added Maken, who was addressing a press conference. Claiming that the Centre took the decision to appease US President Donald Trump, Maken said: "Two days ago, Trump said e-cigarettes should be banned. Had the government taken the step before his comments, we could have thought that the move was not aimed at appeasing Trump." The Congress' response came hours after Union Cabinet approved an ordinance for a comprehensive ban on e-cigarettes, which covers their production, manufacture, import, export, transport, sale, distribution, storage and advertisement. Violations are a cognisable offence punishable with an imprisonment of up to one year or fine up to Rs 1 lakh or both for the first offence and imprisonment of up to three years and fine up to Rs 5 lakh for a subsequent offence. The storage of electronic-cigarettes shall also be punishable with imprisonment up to six months or fine up to Rs 50,000 or both.	web										
126	33608c00-02ba-38d3-98a8-e684c90ea0b0	The FDA Can't Tell the Difference between Eggplants and Tobacco	The Food and Drug Administration just made it clear that it cannot tell the difference between eggplants and tobacco leaves. It has assumed control over nicotine that does not come from tobacco but rather is derived from vegetables or created in labs.  The FDA has now seized control of eggplant-related products.This development is part of the continued fallout over the FDA’s 499-page “deeming regs,” which brought e-cigarettes, e-liquid, and devices used for vaping under its tobacco-control authority.  Boston University professor Michael Siegel submitted a simple question to the FDA: “Are e-cigs that do not contain nicotine (or any other tobacco extracts) also covered by the FDA deeming regulations? If so, will they also require pre-market approval like products that do contain nicotine?”  In a drawn-out response posted July 25, the FDA wrote that it does indeed have regulatory power over e-liquid that is not derived from tobacco. This attempts to clarify the FDA’s regulations, but all it does is reiterate that the FDA is waging a war on both orally inhaled nicotine and nicotine-free e-liquid — not tobacco.  Nicotine is addictive, not deadly.Nicotine is present in many foods that humans eat (including eggplants, potatoes, and tomatoes), and it can be created in a lab. Some e-liquid companies are already selling synthetic, tobacco-free nicotine. While nicotine is addictive, it is uncontroversial that the carcinogens and toxins released from burning cigarettes are what kills smokers. The FDA even admitted this much by stating in its “deeming regs” that nicotine exposure is “not responsible for the high prevalence of tobacco-related death and disease in this country.”  E-liquid does not burn, nor does it contain the vast majority of dangerous toxins found in cigarettes. This is why the British Royal College of Physicians found that vaping e-liquid is 95 percent safer than smoking cigarettes.  This treatment of vaping — even when e-liquid has no connection to tobacco — shows that the FDA’s reasoning is circular at best and a deadly power grab at worst. Before looking at direct quotes from the FDA, here is how the FDA’s example of torturous logic proceeds:  From page 257 of the FDA’s regulations:  The definition of “tobacco product” includes any product made or derived from tobacco, including any component, part, or accessory of a tobacco product. An e-liquid made or derived from tobacco meets this definition and, therefore, is subject to FDA’s chapter IX authorities. E-liquids that do not contain nicotine or other substances derived from tobacco may still be components or parts and, therefore, subject to FDA’s tobacco control authorities, if they are an assembly of materials intended or reasonably expected to be used with or for the human consumption of a tobacco product and do not meet the definition of accessory.  Congress could have authorized this – but it didn’t. There are major problems with the FDA’s power grab. If Congress wanted the FDA to have control of all products that contain nicotine, it would have spelled that out in law. Instead, Congress limited the purview of the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act to tobacco and smoking. Simply put, Congress did not grant the FDA the power to regulate any substance that contains nicotine as a tobacco product.  As if the FDA’s unauthorized extension of its regulatory authority to non-tobacco-derived nicotine was not enough, it also claims it can regulate e-liquid that does not contain any nicotine — which is the most common type of e-liquid used by teenagers. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, only 29 percent of 12th-graders who vaped reported using e-liquid that contained nicotine (or were unsure).  The FDA has no clue how to improve smokers’ health.To show just how clueless the government is when it comes to reducing the harms of cigarette smoking, the FDA wrote on page 218 of its deeming regs that “regardless of the nicotine content of the tobacco products, FDA believes that deeming tobacco products will result in significant public health benefits and that the additional restrictions imposed by this rule are appropriate for the protection of the public health.”  In reality, all FDA control of vaping will do is stifle innovation in a dynamic industry, making it harder for smokers to kick their deadly habit or for young people to avoid getting hooked in the first place. Vaping has been shown to be much more effective at helping smokers quit than going cold turkey or using other nicotine-replacement therapies such as patches or gum. Vaping’s increase in popularity has also occurred during a major decline in high-school smoking rates (from 15.7 percent in 2013 to 10.8 percent in 2015).  If the FDA’s main concern is public health, it desperately needs to learn the difference between smoking and vaping — and the difference between tobacco and eggplants.

127	2cbb938b-8bb0-3f9e-807c-8f2df448e407	Oregon lawmakers want to raise tobacco purchase age from 18 to 21	Oregon would become the third state to raise the age of sale for tobacco products from 18 to 21 if lawmakers pass legislation backed by the American Cancer Society.  Sen. Elizabeth Steiner Hayward, D-Beaverton, announced Wednesday morning that she will soon introduce a bill that would prohibit retailers from selling any tobacco product – including e-cigarettes – to anyone younger than 21.  Rep. Rich Vial, R-Scholls, also is sponsoring the bill, which the pair said has strong bipartisan support.  California and Hawaii already have the requirement. A similar bill failed in Washington last year.  Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death in Oregon, killing more than 5,500 Oregonians annually, according to the American Cancer Society.  Each year, roughly 1,800 Oregon kids become new daily smokers, the organization said, and unless current smoking rates decline, 68,000 Oregon kids alive today will die prematurely from tobacco use.  Dr. Brian Druker, director of the Oregon Health & Science University Knight Cancer Center, said the peak age for getting addicted to tobacco is between 18 and 21 years old.  “This bill will decrease the number of people who start smoking in our state by about 20 percent, and that translates into 1,000 lives saved per year,” Druker said.  Steiner Hayward introduced a similar bill in the 2015 session. This time, however, there are no criminal penalties.  The bill would impose no punishment on youth caught with tobacco. For a first offense, retail clerks selling to youth under 21 would receive a $50 civil penalty, and their managers would be fined $500. Fines would increase for subsequent offenses.  “As a family physician, I think it’s always better to prevent disease than to cure it,” Steiner Hayward said. “And one of the best things we can do in Oregon to prevent disease is to stop people from using tobacco and other dangerous products that contain nicotine and other harmful substances.”	bing										
128	9c0d0df0-411b-3c45-89e9-55c44c24881d	New Jersey becomes 3rd state to raise smoking age to 21	TRENTON, N.J. — Republican Gov. Chris Christie signed a law Friday making New Jersey the third state to raise its smoking age to 21.  Christie cited the strain on the health care system caused by tobacco-related illnesses. He also noted his mother died from the effects of smoking.  "By raising the minimum age to purchase tobacco products to 21, we are giving young people more time to develop a maturity and better understanding of how dangerous smoking can be and that it is better to not start smoking in the first place," Christie wrote.  Previously, the age was 19. The restriction applies to tobacco products and electronic smoking devices. Christie vetoed a similar measure last year.  Hawaii and California are the only other states where the smoking age is 21. A bill raising the age in Maine from 18 to 21 is awaiting Republican Gov. Paul LePage, who has not said whether he will sign it.  Reports show smoking causes about $4 billion in health care costs to New Jersey each year, said Democratic Sens. Richard Codey and Joseph Vitale, co-sponsors of the bill Christie signed into law. That amount doesn't include costs related to secondhand smoke or smokeless tobacco use, they said.  "Data surveys show that if individuals aren't smokers by 21 years of age, they will most likely not start later in their lives," Vitale said. "Making it harder to buy cigarettes by raising the age to legally purchase them in New Jersey will help prevent our youth from becoming lifelong smokers and suffering the long-term effects of the habit."  John Horgan had a plan to prevent himself from bawling his eyes out during his swearing-in ceremony ...

129	22a87df8-7e34-36cd-b822-dafcd43d8fbb	Smokers pay lots in tax and save public money by dying early, report says	Published:06:44Monday 07 August 2017  Smoking is worth almost £15 billion to the public purse because of the tax revenue and the savings from smokers’ early deaths, according to a think tank’s analysis.  The free market Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) calculated the cost of smoking at £4.6 billion, including treating diseases, tidying up dropped cigarette butts and putting out house fires.  But tobacco duties brought in £9.5 billion a year and the Government saves £9.8 billion in pension, healthcare and other benefit payments because of the premature deaths of smokers.  The think tank accused politicians of “scapegoating” smokers, drinkers and the obese, claiming the £24.7 billion revenue from “sin taxes” far outweighed the costs they impose on the public finances.  “Taken together, Britain’s public finances would be £22.8 billion worse off if there were no drinking, smoking or obesity,” the IEA research paper said.  The report’s co-author Christopher Snowdon, head of lifestyle economics at the IEA said: “We are constantly being told that people who choose to drink, smoke or eat too much are a burden on the UK taxpayer.  “This is one reason why we have seen such aggressive hikes in taxes on alcohol, smoking and very soon, a tax on sugar. But the justification for these taxes is based on an illusion.  “Smokers, drinkers and those who are obese actually provide a net benefit to the public finances, so vilifying them is futile in the quest to make savings for the NHS.  “A careful consideration of the evidence shows that the popular belief that costs will fall if people live healthier and for longer is false. While it’s good that we now have longer life expectancies, policymakers must now address how we tackle the financial consequences of the ageing population rather than pointing the finger elsewhere.”	mention.com

That extra cup of coffee, sushi, and after work drinks become a thing of the past — at least for those crucial months. But despite extensive research proving the risks, smoking and drinking during pregnancy is still a problem, according to a study conducted in the United Kingdom. Rather than heed the warnings of their health care providers, women are smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol behind closed doors to avoid public judgement. Researchers from Cardiff Universityinterviewed expectant women to determine their smoking and drinking habits while pregnant, as well as their feelings about the experiences. According to statistics released by the Welsh government — where Cardiff University is located — 21 percent of women in the country are still smoking when they attend their first prenatal appointment. Some of these women reported feeling "irritated and alienated" by those around them if they smoked or drank in public, according to the BBC. Ultimately, feeling judged made the women less likely to seek support for their smoking and drinking. And while some women also reported that they were judged negatively by their partners for choosing to smoke or consume alcohol, others reported that their significant others encouraged them to drink alcoholic beverages while at home, according to The Independent. Negative feedback from partners and midwives did little to stop women from smoking, according to MedicalXpress. Instead, they just began to do so in private, and told researchers that they believe it is "acceptable" for pregnant women to make these choices behind closed doors. In response to these findings, researchers recommended that concerned parties employ empathy instead of judgement. Study author Dr. Aimee Grant, from Cardiff University's Centre for Trials Research, told the BBC as much. "Moral judgements are commonly directed towards mothers through reference to health behavior in pregnancy, and working-class mothers are particularly subject to this criticism, ignoring the challenges of living on a low income," she said. Dr. Grant added, "Our study shows that these looks and comments — including by members of the public — irritate and alienate pregnant women, making them less likely to seek help. No one wants to be judged and shamed." Smoking during pregnancy has been linked to lower birth weight in infants, premature delivery, miscarriage, birth defects, and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For these reasons, it is advised that women stop smoking before getting pregnant or as soon as they know they are expecting, ideally while still in the first trimester. But Dr. Melissa Goist, OB/GYN, Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center told SheKnows that it is never too late to quit. "Although smoking cessation in the first trimester is recommended, literature shows that there are fetal benefits to smoking cessation throughout pregnancy," she said. "It is never too late to get a mother to stop smoking for her benefit as well as her children and unborn children." Dr. Dunla Gallagher, co-author of the study published by Cardiff University, told the BBC that for many some low-income, expectant mothers, smoking is a "coping strategy" and "rather than stigma, women need empathy and a recognition of the challenges that pregnancy can bring in terms of women's independent choices." If you are expecting a child and struggling to give up smoking or drinking habits, seek help. If you feel uncomfortable speaking with your doctor or midwife about it — because of perceptions of judgement or any other reason — there are a number of resources available to you. The NHS offers a Smoke Free Hotline as well as one-on-one counseling sessions for those located in the United Kingdom. And for expectant mothers in the United States, the CDC offers a lengthy list of resources to help you quit smoking. And finally, for those interacting with pregnant women who may be smoking or drinking, give them what they really need: support, not judgement.	google										
131	b6954e3f-9267-3d28-af50-fea414d5c9be	Children as young as 12 given nicotine patches at school to help them quit smoking	Children as young as 12 are being given nicotine patches as part of a national bid to help them quit smoking.    H ealth advisers are being sent into schools to conduct ‘Support to Stop Smoking’ sessions with the schoolchildren.    The children - between the ages of 12 and 17 - are then offered vouchers which can be used to 'buy' nicotine replacement products such as lozenges and patches at pharmacies.  The legal age to buy cigarettes is 18.      NHS guidelines say children as young as 12 can access nicotine patches from chemists and GPs throughout the country, but that it is at the discretion of individual primary care trusts which services they offer.    The project is already underway at schools in North Somerset.     Nailsea School holds quit smoking sessions on Tuesdays, which are led by the school’s first aider, who has undergone the smoke free training.  Becky Pollard, director of public health at NHS North Somerset, which took over responsibility for public health in April, said: 'We are delighted that the school is committed to providing this valuable service.     ' Young people can become addicted to tobacco very easily, and this can affect their ability to concentrate, as well as leading to them to smoke on site and can result in smoking-related exclusions.  ' Smokefree North Somerset works closely with schools providing programmes that prevent the uptake of smoking in young people and supporting schools to support young people who smoke.  ' The service is based on behavioural support and Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) which is available for young people aged 12 and over as recommended in the NICE guidance.  ' NRT is usually via patches and lozenges as gum is not acceptable in schools.'  The service, which is being run by the council’s Smoke Free North Somerset team, has been offered to all secondary schools and academies across the district.  So far Nailsea School, Gordano School in Portishead and Hans Price Academy in Weston-super-Mare have signed up.  As well as the nicotine therapy, students work with advisors to learn about the health dangers of smoking.  Statistics by charity Cancer Research show an estimated 545 young people start smoking in North Somerset each year.  Councillor Reyna Knight, North Somerset Council assistant executive member for public health, said: 'If we can intervene early and stop children from developing a smoking habit it will prevent problems in the long term, not only for their health but also for the NHS.  ' Also if children are in class and craving a cigarette, they will not be concentrating on the work they are supposed to be doing.'	bing

Last year, only 5% of high school sophomores said they had smoked cigarettes daily in the last 30 days, compared with 18% of sophomores who were smoking daily at one point in the 1990s. The numbers have also plunged for eighth-graders and high school seniors, hitting their lowest point since the surveys began.     The change is just one of the findings in a vast new report on the well-being of American children, compiled by the Federal Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics. The report drew together research from a host of government agencies and research groups, including the National Institute on Drug Abuse, which tracked cigarette smoking.     Besides being less likely to smoke, U.S. kids are less likely to be exposed to secondhand smoke, the report showed. The percentage of nonsmoking kids ages 4 to 11 whose blood had a detectable level of cotinine, a breakdown product of nicotine, fell from 53% to 42% from 2007-08 to 2009-10.

A similar law went into effect in Hawaii on Jan. 1. Paul J. Richards / AFP/Getty Images Gov. Jerry Brown signed a sweeping package of tobacco bills into California law on Wednesday, including one that will raise the legal age to buy products from 18 to 21 and another that dramatically tightens restrictions on e-cigarettes. But the governor vetoed a bill that would have permitted cities and counties to establish their own tobacco taxes. "Although California has one of the lowest cigarette taxes in the nation," the governor said in a veto message, "I am reluctant to approve this measure in view of all the taxes being proposed for the 2016 ballot." California becomes just the second state after Hawaii to raise the lawful age to buy tobacco products, a move that backers applaud as a certain way to curtail harm to adolescents, and reduce the number of adult smokers. State Sen. Ed Hernandez, a Democrat from West Covina, was the lead author of the bill to raise the tobacco age, and says he's "ecstatic." "What this means for California is now we can know that our youth are less likely to be addicted to this horrible drug of tobacco," he says. "There's going to be less addiction to tobacco, [and] we're going to reduce health care costs and save lives." The law, which will take effect June 9, applies to all 18 to 20-year-olds, except military personnel. The bill had stalled for months until a compromise was reached to permit service members under 21 to continue purchasing tobacco. A major Institute of Medicine report last year concluded that if all states raised the tobacco age to 21, there would be a 12 percent drop in the number of teen and young adult smokers. "The biggest drops in tobacco use (will) likely occur among teens ages 15 to 17 — kids who can't legally buy tobacco products in California now but who run in the same social circles as 18-year-olds who may illegally purchase tobacco products for younger friends," said Larry Cohen , executive director of the Prevention Institute, in Oakland, Calif., and a longtime advocate for tobacco control policies. Adolescents are at particular risk for nicotine addiction because their brains are still developing, says longtime tobacco critic, Stanton Glantz , director of the Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education at the University of California, San Francisco. "Exposing the developing brain to nicotine, which is in both e-cigarettes and conventional cigarettes, physically changes the brain," Glantz says. "That's why the younger someone starts to smoke, the more addicted they tend to get ... and the harder time they have stopping. Vaping Banned In Many Public Places But the new regulations on e-cigarettes may be even more significant, Glantz says. "There's no question that e-cigarettes aren't as dangerous as cigarettes are," he says, "but they're still dangerous." Under the law , written by state Sen. Mark Leno, a Democrat from San Francisco, e-cigarettes will be banned in all the same places that traditional cigarettes are — workplaces, schools, restaurants, hospitals and more. And like other tobacco products, users will need to be 21 to buy e-cigarettes. "The e-cigarette is nothing more than a new delivery system for toxic and addictive nicotine," Leno said in a written statement. "Ensuring that e-cigarettes fall under California's comprehensive smoke-free laws is critical to protecting public health, especially given the alarming rate at which young people are picking up these devices." A study last year from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that e-cigarette use among middle and high school students tripled from 2013 to 2014. Brown signed three other bills: An expansion of smoke-free workplaces to include hotel lobbies, bars, banquet rooms and employee break rooms Expansion of eligibility for tobacco prevention funds to charter schools An increase of tobacco retailer license fees from a one-time $100 fee to an annual $265 fee Anti-tobacco groups are now focusing their efforts on an effort to gather signatures for a November ballot initiative that would raise cigarette taxes from the current $0.87 per pack to $2. While California is seen as tough on tobacco, it ranks 36th in the country on per-pack taxes. A 2012 ballot initiative to raise taxes by $1 per pack failed by less than half a percentage point after the tobacco industry spent $47 million to defeat it. A statewide Field poll last year found that two-thirds of California voters support an increase in tobacco taxes. This story was produced by KQED's State of Health blog.

135	d027fe05-cddd-3d57-986c-4fabc6ead535	California raises smoking age starting Thursday	A new California law that takes another bold step to limit smoking goes into effect Thursday, raising the age limit to buy tobacco products from 18 to 21.  Another new law bans e-cigarettes from public places such as schools, restaurants and hospitals.  California will be the second state in the nation after Hawaii to have an age requirement of 21 to purchase tobacco — a feat which state Sen. Ed Hernandez, author of the bill, says he is excited about. He predicts a "significant drop" in tobacco use.  “I think California is taking a leadership role in curbing tobacco use and tobacco products,” Hernandez, a Democrat, said in an interview. “Hopefully, all states in the United States will eventually move to 21 and reduce smoking even more."  Hernandez said there could be some backlash or slightly more illegal underage tobacco use, though he thinks it will deter far more potential users. The Institute of Medicine found that if all states required a minimum age to purchase tobacco 21, it would lead to a 12% drop in smokers.  The bills were backed by an advocacy group, the Save Lives California coalition, made up of doctors and healthcare workers from the American Lung Association, the California Medical Association, the American Cancer Society and other organizations.  “I think tomorrow is a proud example of California taking the lead to protect our kids and stand up to big tobacco,” said Mike Roth, spokesperson for Save Lives California.  California e-cigarette smokers will also see restrictions after Thursday. All e-cigarette and vapor products will be reclassified as traditional tobacco products in the law. This law is opposed by the Smoke-Free Alternatives Trade Association – a lobbying group for vapor products—which calls the provision a “step backwards.”  "Stigmatizing vapor products, which contain no tobacco and treating them the same as combustible cigarettes opens the door to excessive taxation that will economically penalize smokers looking to make the switch to vaping.,” said Josh Krane, president of the California chapters of the SFATA.	bing

But the Mountain State ought to do the right thing regarding one settlement - and in the process, save some young lives.  Ours was one of many states involved in a 1998 settlement with tobacco companies, over their marketing of products that are hazardous to people's health. Under the settlement, states began receiving huge cash payments from the companies. That will continue until 2025.  A total of $25.6 billion is being paid to about 22 states this year, through the settlement.  Eager to have cash in hand, state officials in 2007 netted about $807 million through sale of bonds backed by the state's future proceeds from the settlement.  But comparatively little is going into programs to convince people not to use tobacco products and to help those who do quit.  During the current fiscal year, the state will spend only about $4.9 million on such programs, according to the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends West Virginia be spending $27.4 million a year.  Meanwhile, an estimated 4,300 West Virginians die of tobacco-related illnesses each year. Our state has the highest rates of smoking for both juveniles and adults in the nation.  Too often, settlements from "consumer" or "health" lawsuits do little to benefit those for whom the actions allegedly were filed. States see settlements as windfalls to be used for any number of other purposes. Here in West Virginia, that policy ought to be re-examined.	google										
137	08164ba9-dad9-3c62-a89c-3a04414b8b15	Swisher Entering Premium Cigar Market	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- Swisher International is entering the premium cigar market with the launch of its new Royal Gold Cigars division. The tobacco company has tapped cigar industry veteran Alex Goldman to lead the division, which was specifically created to build upon his experience.  "Alex's leadership of House of Oxford/Mom's Cigars as its owner and president for the past 20 years positions him perfectly to develop and market our new premium cigar lineup," said Peter Ghiloni, president of Swisher International.  Goldman will lead Royal Gold Cigars in developing and introducing various lines to compete with key players in the premium cigar market. Test marketing of the new product lineup is planned for April, with a national launch slated for the International Premium Cigar & Pipe Retailers Association (IPCPR) Annual Convention & International Trade Show in July in Las Vegas.  "As a fourth-generation tobacconist, I have cemented relationships that will enable Royal Gold Cigars to develop, source and market an array of premium products that customers will enjoy at competitive price points," Goldman explained. "Operating as a division of Swisher International gives Royal Gold Cigars the opportunity to tap into Swisher's leadership and leverage its resources, while maintaining an independent business model."  Jacksonville, Fla.-based Swisher International has manufactured tobacco products since 1861 and ships more than one billion cigars a year to more than 60 countries.  "This is an exciting new chapter for Swisher International [that] aligns with our growth plans in several key areas of the overall tobacco market," Ghiloni concluded.	bing

Eric Holcomb's legislative agenda focuses largely on health care and education, but there were some surprises, such as banning cellphone use while driving. The governor announced the agenda today in a 40-minute presentation to the Terre Haute Chamber of Commerce. In the past couple of years, he's been traveling the state to release his priorities, giving the speech last year in Zionsville. Buy Photo Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb wants to ban cellphones while driving, raise the smoking age and add protections for pregnant workers.(Photo: Michelle Pemberton/IndyStar) Here are the takeaways: Ban phone use while driving He's cracking down on distracted driving. Nearly everyone has seen cars weave from one lane to the next while the driver stares down at his or her lap. Under one proposal, drivers would no longer be able to use hand-held phones or other telecommunications devices — in any way, unless they are hands free. Indiana law bans texting, but not any other phone use, such as posting or messaging on social media sites such as Facebook or Twitter. He said the risk of a crash more than triples when driving while using a device and noted that 20 states have already banned their use while driving. "When you're texting, texting can kill," Holcomb told the chamber. "That's not an overstatement. We just know that folks who are distracted on our highways and backroads are increasing accidents about three and a half times." Afterward, he told reporters he thinks police will be able to enforce the ban, despite difficulty they've had in enforcing the ban on texting. "You try," he said of enforcing it. "When you're driving down the road you can count more than not folks who are distracted. I just cringe — and when I'm not driving — when I look at someone not look up for four or five seconds." State Police Superintendent Doug Carter, who traveled with the governor to the chamber event, told IndyStar he thinks a wider ban will be easier to enforce than the current law against texting. Now, he said, it's difficult to prove that someone using a phone while driving is specifically texting. Since the law was passed, he said, it's become more common for people to use social media or stream movies and shows on their devices as technology has evolved. And, he noted, many devices can now be used hands free, which would be legal under the proposed law. Raise the smoking age to 21 Like key lawmakers, Holcomb wants to raise the age to purchase any tobacco products, including cigarettes and vaping products, from 18 to 21 years old. He also proposes to increase fines for retailers who sell such products to underage individuals, though it's not yet clear precisely by how much. His administration said 95 percent of smokers start before they turn 21. Holcomb said too many high school and middle school teens have started vaping, especially. "I thought it was pretty cool when I was in middle school sneaking gum," he joked to the chamber. Afterward, he told reporters he's open to considering a ban on flavored e-cigarettes or raising the tobacco tax at some point in the future. But for now, he said he wants to focus on raising the age limit, which he called long overdue. Raising taxes, especially, would be a tougher sell in the Republican-controlled legislature, where such measures have failed in recent years. 'We will look at anything that will help reduce smoking and all of the costs associated with that," he said, "most importantly qualify of life, in the future. But first things first; we've got a short session to deal with." Make health care costs transparent The governor wants to create a claims database to ensure the cost of health care services are more transparent before services begin. Providers would have to give estimates 2-5 days before treatment. As part of that, in-network hospitals would be required to provide in-network services for every part of a treatment plan. Under current law, patients might find that their surgeon is in network but the anesthesiologist on duty is out of network. Give teachers a win, kind of Holcomb was noticeably absent at a massive teacher rally at the Statehouse several weeks ago, but he’s heard their concerns – or at least some of them. The governor’s agenda includes two of the three asks teacher took to state leaders at the Red for Ed action day last month. He is asking lawmakers to make a divisive professional development requirement optional, rather than mandatory. During the last legislative session, lawmakers added 15 hours of workforce-related professional development to the list of requirements for teacher license renewal. In response, thousands of teachers rushed to begin their license renewal process before the new requirements kicked in. The state's teachers union has asked for it to be repealed. He's also renewing his call to hold schools and teachers harmless from abysmal scores on the state's new standardized test, which was another demand from the state's educators. Holcomb is standing firm, though, in his position that teacher pay will be an issue for 2021, the next budget-writing year. Bill for EMT care Holcomb wants emergency medical providers to be able to bill insurance any time they render services. Under current law, ambulance services only bill insurance if patients are transported to the hospital. Holcomb's administration said EMTs sometimes provide services only on the scene of an incident, but receive no payments through insurances. "This is something the Fire Department in Crawfordsville has done," he said. "They've proven it can be done and it's saved time and money and ultimately lives." Add protections for pregnant workers Holcomb wants to ensure pregnant employees have access to more frequent breaks and temporary job restructuring. His administration said 25 states already do so. The problem, his administration said, is pregnancy is not covered under the Disability Act. Require mental health care in schools Holcomb is calling on all school districts to establish a relationship with a mental health care provider. Schools do not have to hire mental health providers to work in their buildings, but have at least a referral relationship established in the event a student is in need. By 2022, schools without this relationship will not be eligible to receive money from the state’s Secured School Safety Grant. The program awards grants for schools to hire security officers or complete “target hardening” projects, like more secure entrances or upgraded surveillance systems. Last session, lawmakers expanded the ways the grant dollars could be used to include mental health for the first time. Currently, though, that’s only for a narrow parent-focused program. There was language that would have broadened the uses to include other mental health expenses and social emotional programming, but it was removed. Officials within the Holcomb administration said they would like to see uses of the safety grant program expanded, but that likely won’t happen until at least 2021. The governor wants to combine the Family and Social Services' call centers into Indiana 211 program, which connects Hoosiers to other health and human services programs. As part of that, United Way would remain within the program. The nonprofit had discussed leaving 211, his administration said. Pay for some projects with cash To save an estimated $125 million on debt costs, Holcomb wants to pay for roughly $300 million worth of projects with cash instead of debt. The change in payment doesn't move up the timeline for any of the projects, it's just a cost-savings move. They include, at this point, $73 million for a veterinary clinic at Purdue, $60 million for facilities at Ball State, $50 million for a pavilion at the state fairgrounds, $48 million for a facility at University of Southern Indiana Health Professions and $30 million for Ivy Tech-Columbus. Other priorities Holcomb also discussed a number of projects that he hopes to begin in 2020 that don't require legislative approval. He discussed the Indiana Destination Development Corp, which will work with the state tourism bureau to attract jobs, talent and visitors. He also discussed the I-69 through Martinsville project, which will be complete in 2022, building a new bridge over the Ohio River at Henderson, Ky., building a new port in Lawrenceburg, and adding nonstop flights to the Indianapolis International Airport. Democrats not impressed The reaction from Democrats was swift and critical. State chairman John Zody called Holcomb's agenda bland and said the governor needed actionable steps to raise teacher salaries. "It can wait," Zody said, "shouldn't be a governing edict." House Democratic Leader Phil GiaQuinta said his party would continue to push for more money for teachers in the 2020 session. “Indiana House Democrats intend to pursue a Hoosiers First agenda that includes making health care more accessible and affordable," he said, "providing children with quality care that their parents can afford, investing in public education, giving teachers the pay raise they deserve, and ensuring that our children can go to school to learn in a safe environment." But the governor's legislative priorities were praised by fellow Republicans, including House Speaker Brian Bosma and Senate President Pro Tempore Rodric Bray, as well as the Indiana Chamber of Commerce, which has endorsed the governor in the 2020 election. "Gov. Holcomb laid out a strong vision for the coming year," Bosma said, "and we look forward to working with him and our Senate colleagues to accomplish our shared goals."	rss

140	699f4f32-224e-3b30-a048-4d5d8cd9753b	The Twisty Mini can help smokers still enjoy a hit, but a lot more responsibly	Overall cigarette use has dropped by a hefty 26 percent over the past decade according to the American Lung Association. And you can bet that of those who consumed that remaining 74 percent, almost every single one of them knew tobacco smoke was not doing anything to help improve their overall health. Of course, one way to curtail your intake of tobacco is to do what smokers have done for decades: tapering off their tobacco use to a few puffs here and there. For those looking to ease back on tobacco smoking or any other herb, the Twisty Mini Glass Blunt Tobacco Pipe can be an effective way to pare back slowly while still enjoying the occasional hit. Made from premium 2mm thick glass, this tobacco pipe is only 5 inches long, fits in the palm of your hand, and can only hold up to 1.5 grams of tobacco or other substances. While the restraint is built right in, the quality construction of the Twisty Mini is still undeniable, offering a clean pull every time. All users have to do is pack in their tobacco or herb, twist the screw counter-clockwise into the tube, then light up the end. Once that portion is ash, users just twist the screw back the other way, pushing the ash out of the tube and automatically loading the next pinch of fresh herb for your next hit. By splitting up the substance, the Twisty Mini not only limits the portions but also keeps a lid on the intensity of the effects. That way, the user can decide if they've had enough or they're ready for more. Of course, at that size, the Twisty Mini is also incredibly easy to carry and use. It's also much easier to make it unobtrusive, so if you'd like to keep your smoking habits to yourself, the Twisty Mini is a good way not to draw attention to it. Big Brother is licking you.

The new law will take effect in October after Gov. Mike DeWine signed it this week. Ohio is one of 18 states that have raised the minimum age for purchasing cigarettes, cigars, electronic cigarettes and other tobacco products. The new law also applies to rolling papers, filters and other smoking and vaping accessories. National statistics show Ohio has one of the highest rates of adult smokers at just over 21%. Backers of the new law say the goal is to prevent children from starting to smoke.	rss										
143	7d155085-fd95-3c8e-9db6-51455741ea36	Tobacco, vaping and harm reduction - a Swedish cliffhanger	An owner of a vapeshop once told me about a doctor, working in a hospital a couple of blocks from the store. The doctor, he told me, usually sent his patients, those who were smokers, to his shop to try vaping. It happened every other week and had been going on for years.“Now that´s amazing” I said. “That’s a story I need to write. Can you hook us up?”The immediate answer was:“No, he wouldn´t want me to do that”He made it clear that any kind of publicity would mean the doctor would be out of practice within a month.“He´d be next to unemployable as well, you know. Blacklisted, going against all recommendations made by the national college of physicians.” Said the vape shop owner. The one that got away I think about this story when pondering the ups and downs of my year as a KAC scholar (one of lucky 25 in the world!) developing news coverage and addressing tobacco harm reduction policy in regards to vaping in Sweden. It’s been more or less successful, goals have been met, plenty of news have been produced, satisfying interviews conducted and stories have been told. But it’s always been that feeling of the one that got away. THAT story. Green meat goblin As a journalist I have caused some people trouble. Often unintentionally. Like when the owner of a grocery store found greenish meat in his delivery. He wanted to go public, just to raise awareness about how additives in the preservation process of meat sometimes makes it discoloured. It was green.“But it’s normal and perfectly safe to eat” he said.He asked me to write an article about it for the local paper, where I was working at the time. And so I did. It made big headlines of course. “Green meat in local store – proclaimed safe”. And a picture of him holding the green fillet, smiling to the camera. He was very pleased with the article. Then he lost 75 percent of his customers. He almost went out of business and became forever known locally as “the Green meat Goblin”. So much for good intentions.But it was a good story. Snus, vaping and big tobacco Tobacco harm reduction is kind of like the green meat of Swedish public health policy. This quickly became clear when I connected with both scientists and politicians. Harm reductionfor smokers, in many minds, is a concept connected to the tobacco companies. Especially here in Sweden, where the snus manufacturer Swedish Match are running campaigns to promote it. E-cigarettes even more so, even though not a single brand of vaping devices sold in Sweden are big tobacco products, excluding the rare IQOS. Knowledge and education futile This is peculiar. And symptomatic of a one-sided story being the only one told. Tobacco harm reduction is not a scientific subject here. It´s a a tactic to sell more nicotine products, according to the the opposition. This is reflected in a strict narrative, replicated by ideologically driven scientists, doctors and well known health organizations in Sweden. They advocate against tobacco companies, no more, no less. I asked another doctor, and well known swedish snus advocate, about this.“It´s a cluster of doctors and scientist working together to drive policy. Many practitioners are aware of tobacco harm reduction and support it. But they won´t say that in public. They risk to lose both financing and jobs” he said. Vaping and snus are considered “smoking in disguise” and anyone who claims to know better is by definition an advocate for harm. Like our elusive doctor sending smokers to a vape shop – just another “Green meat Goblin”. Knowledge and education is futile – or unwanted. And that’s the end of the story. Unwilling vaping advocate This also became to evident in my project to address THR and vaping among swedish politicians.During the period of the KAC scholarship I reached out to eight parties in the swedish parliament. 6 answered my questions.Well, almost.I realized when talking to Swedish politicians on the topic of vaping and harm reduction, that the pure question-answer format (as is custom for me as a reporter) often failed. Interviews became “reversed”. Answers became questions. I was being interviewed. What is vaping like? Why do you want a fake cigarette? And so on. I became the informant, an unwilling advocate.Good for lobbying. Not ideal for a news story. Flavors, flavors, flavors I´ve conducted well over 15 interviews, written over 20 articles on Swedish topics during these 12 months of my KAC scholarship. My conclusion is that Swedish politicians are interested in harm reduction no doubt, but when it comes to vaping – a majority knows next to nothing about current research, user habits or anything related to smoking cessation with vaping.But they do care about flavors. A majority want them banned.“It’s obvious the tobacco industry is targeting kids or just other non-smokers with all of them fruit flavors. Don´t you see that? What kind of a smoker would even consider trying a strawberry gum flavor?”Asked the representative of the Swedish leftist party, who cooperates with the ruling Social democrats in parliament. And they are, together with the government, all for a sweeping ban of e-cigarette flavorings. The good story I asked the representative if this is what she would tell the well over 100 000 swedes (i.e. voters) who are using e-cigarettes to quit smoking.“But they don´t use these flavors do they? I can´t imagine they want anything but tobacco flavors. Right?” she asked me.“I would imagine they do” I said “They buy them in heaps. And they are smokers. They want to quit cigarettes and they use many different flavors. What do you want to tell them?”There was silence. Unusual for this particular politician. She talks. A lot.“Ok” she said. “I realize this is a complicated issue. Maybe we need to know more. Could you mail me some information and I´ll have my secretary look in to it?”And that was the end of the interview. Maybe she should talk to that elusive doctor? I thought. We actually met a couple of months later. In a vapeshop. Turns out her husband was (is?) a smoker. She listened. At least for a while. But that´s a good story. Right? Or is this just another case of a green meat goblin in the making? We´ll never know. I haven´t written that article yet. Probably never will. A cliffhanger Coming to some sort of conclusion, the story of my KAC scholarship is one of hope and despair. And part comedy, even though, as I’m writing this report, the Swedish government is preparing to ban all flavors except tobacco in e-liquids and e-cigarettes (even those without nicotine). I wanted to cover the Swedish stance on vaping and THR and my timing couldn´t have been better.And it absolutely makes for a good story. But with a cliffhanger. Importance of presence The KAC scholarship made this possible. The scholarship, with educational and knowledge support has been invaluable to me, as a reporter and as a THR educator. By developing Vejpkollen as a platform, I have connected to both politicians and organizations involved in tobacco harm reduction. This presence will be important for the coming year and in the development of Sweden’s new Vaping Consumers Association (an organization formed primarily to fight the flavour ban). Vejpkollen will definitely be a part of this and hopefully this is the start of something great for vapers in Sweden. Yes, I would gladly take your money And last but not least.

146	08b9f58a-02f5-3e42-9454-33d2bb786a1b	Atlanta mayor OKs smoking ban in bars, restaurants, airport	ATLANTA (AP) — The mayor of Atlanta has signed legislation banning smoking and vaping in enclosed areas such as bars, restaurants and the smoking rooms in one of the world’s busiest airports. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports the legislation signed by Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms will go into effect on Jan. 2. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport has been one of the few major U.S. hubs where people could still smoke inside designated rooms. Airport spokesman Andrew Gobeil has told The Associated Press that the smoking rooms will be repurposed. Smokers will instead be allowed to smoke in an outdoor terminal smoking area before heading through security. The ban excludes private residences and establishments that ban minors and generate at least 20% of their income from tobacco product sales.	bing										
147	81491c5a-f7b5-3cee-9c45-b4f90aefaff4	Treaty Shopping: How Companies Tilt The Legal Playing Field For Investor-State Arbitration	Alongside globe-spanning treaties like ACTA and TPP, there are more subtle efforts to limit the power of national governments, through the use of free trade agreements (FTAs) and bilateral investment treaties (BITs). There are now so many of these that it's hard to keep up, although the dedicated site bilaterals.org is a great help here. The confusing multiplicity only adds to their attractiveness for those negotiating them behind close doors, keen as they are to avoid transparency as much as possible.  One key issue for both FTAs and BITs concerns investor-state arbitration procedures that allow companies, typically powerful global corporations, to take entire nations to court over actions that allegedly cause the company harm -- for example, by introducing stricter environmental legislation that requires additional expenditure at manufacturing plants. The trailblazer in taking advantage of these provisions is the tobacco giant Phillip Morris. Here's what it did in Uruguay, back in 2010: The tobacco giant is suing Uruguay, alleging the country is violating Switzerland’s trade agreement by requiring that anti-smoking warnings cover 80 percent of cigarette packages. If World Bank arbitrators agree, Uruguay could be forced to pay the company millions of dollars.      But Uruguay -- whose Gross Domestic Product is $44 billion -- refuses to back down from Philip Morris, whose market capitalization equals $108 billion. And now the country is getting backing all across the world in its fight against tobacco.  It's also suing Australia for similar reasons: On 1 December 2011 the Tobacco Plain Packaging Act 2011 received Royal Assent and became law in Australia.      The Act forms part of a comprehensive Australian Government strategy to reduce the rate of smoking in Australia. Smoking is one of the leading causes of preventable death and disease in Australia.      Philip Morris Asia is challenging the plain packaging legislation under the 1993 Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of Hong Kong for the Promotion and Protection of Investments. On 21 December 2011, the Australian Government provided its response to Philip Morris Asia's Notice of Arbitration. A fascinating article on the infojustice.org site from a few weeks ago explains the strategy of the tobacco giant here: So why didn't this American company go through the [the main US-Australia FTA]? Because that treaty (1) does not guarantee investor-state dispute, and (2) provides for exemptions to expropriation obligations for limitations on intellectual property rights. Phillip-Morris faced a greater likelihood of failure under the US treaty.      The Hong Kong BIT is also a particularly good choice for Phillip-Morris because, unlike other treaties, it does not include prohibition on claims brought by investors owned by citizens or entities of countries not party to applicable treaty. For example, the BIT with the Czech Republic states: Article 2(2): Where a company of a Contracting Party is owned or controlled by a citizen or a company of any third country, the Contracting Parties may decide jointly in consultation not to extend the rights and benefits of this Agreement to such company. Had the Hong Kong BIT contained this language, Australia could have stopped Phillip Morris International from going through their Asian subsidiary in bringing this claim. Phillip Morris is engaging in "treaty shopping" -- choosing to invoke those FTAs or BITs that contain terms most favorable to its legal action, whether or not they are the most logical or relevant to the dispute in question. That's possible because of the multiplication of these treaties, often with slightly different wording that allows the tobacco company to cherry-pick in this way. As well as deploying it against Australia, Phillip Morris is using the same approach in its fight against Uruguay by invoking the bilateral investment treaty between that country and Switzerland, not the US.  This underlines why it is crucially important for nations to get the wording of investor-state arbitration procedures right when negotiating FTAs, BITs and multilateral treaties like TPP. If they don't, they may well find that global corporations will exploit favorable clauses through the kind of treaty shopping practised by Phillip Morris to put countries at a disadvantage when arguing before international tribunals.

The company calls cigarette smuggling a growing problem. According to spokesman David Howard, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms estimates it annually costs states an estimated $5.5 billion in lost revenue.  “People are coming down from the North on I-95 with trucks and they are buying cartons and cartons of cigarettes in Southern states where tax rates are lower. Then they are transporting them on I-95 and selling them illegally in states like New York and Massachusetts," explains Howard. "The Mackinaw Center in Michigan has estimated that as much as 60 percent of the cigarettes sold in New York are illegally smuggled.”  As a result, Howard says Reynolds American just launched thenewtobaccoroad.com, a website designed to increase public awareness about the community and national impact of cigarette trafficking. The site will provide links to news articles, national research, tax analysis and to law enforcement agencies as they develop possible solutions. In addition, Howard explains cigarette smuggling leads to other illegal gang activities that can threaten the safety of individuals. "There are also ties to terrorism. In the past few years, some people in the Charlotte, Mecklenburg County area, some people were arrested, they have gone through trial and are in prison now for using funds from illegally smuggled cigarettes to fund Hezbollah.”  The site will also share ideas of what municipalities can do to combat this crime. In addition, a former ATF agent will also maintain a blog on the topic.  Reynolds American spokesman David Howard explains how a website will help the company reduce cigarette trafficking.	google

150	8ab589c4-bb3e-3c65-b10d-14bdf5c89db0	E-cigarettes banned on US commercial flights	If you get your nicotine fix from an electronic cigarette, forget about doing so on a commercial flight in the U.S.  U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx announced today in a news release that e-cigarettes would be banned on all scheduled flights of U.S. and foreign carriers into and out of the U.S. The U.S. Transportation Department also extended its ban against smoking to charter flights on which a flight attendant is a required crew member.  “This final rule is important because it protects airline passengers from unwanted exposure to aerosol fumes that occur when electronic cigarettes are used on board airplanes,” Foxx said in the release. “The department took a practical approach to eliminate any confusion between tobacco cigarettes and e-cigarettes by applying the same restrictions to both.”  The release cited studies showing that e-cigarette aerosol can contain harmful chemicals. E-cigarettes are battery-powered devices that replicate smoking, but use a nicotine solution rather than tobacco.  “While further study is needed to fully understand the risks, the department believes that a precautionary approach is best. The department is particularly concerned that vulnerable populations (such as children, the elderly and passengers with respiratory issues) would be exposed to the aerosol within a confined space, without the opportunity to avoid the chemicals,” the release said.  The release said the Transportation Department “views its current regulatory smoking ban to be sufficiently broad to include the use of electronic cigarettes; however, the prior rule did not explicitly define ‘smoking.' The department took this action to eliminate any confusion over whether its ban includes electronic cigarettes.”  Cynthia Cabrera, president of the Smoke-Free Alternatives Trade Association, which bills itself as “the Voice of the Electronic Vapor Industry,” acknowledged the ban but sought to allay concerns about e-cigarettes.  “While we defer to the Transportation Department prohibiting the use of vapor products on commercial flights, it’s important to know that vapor products are fundamentally and scientifically different than combustible tobacco and should not be equated with the harmful effects of smoking," Cabrera said in a news release.  Despite the announcement, it's not clear how many regular air travelers would notice a difference. Information on the website for blue eCigs, citing a “Business Insider” report, says no major U.S. airlines, including American Airlines, Delta, JetBlue, Southwest or United, allow e-cigarette use.  However, the website encourages travelers to check with their airline about whether “vaping” is permitted.  The website says that one of the “awesome things” about the company’s e-cigarettes “is that you can savor them without bothering anyone around you, since electronic cigarettes don’t produce smoke, ash or a nasty smell.”  However, the Food and Drug Administration warns on its website that e-cigarettes can increase nicotine addiction among young people and lead them to try tobacco products, may contain toxic ingredients and that users have no way of knowing if they are safe or what dosage of nicotine they might be inhaling.  The Los Angeles Times reported in October that 12.6%  of U.S. adults have tried an e-cigarette at least once and 3.7% use them regularly.	google										
151	8cbac8ca-97a5-313d-a3f8-f4b4674a6add	Imperial Tobacco announces closure of UK, French factories - Yahoo News	Paris (AFP) - Imperial Tobacco on Tuesday announced the closure of factories in Britain and France with the loss of 900 jobs, citing declining sales in Europe, tougher anti-smoking measures and the growth of contraband sales.  The two factories concerned are at Carquefou, near Nantes in western France, where 327 people are employed, and Nottingham in central England, which has 540 staff.  The company told unions at its French subsidiary Seita that a total of 366 jobs will go in France, where it employs 1,150 people, and 130 new jobs will be created in Poland.  The move means Gauloises, one of the most famous brands owned by Imperial, will be almost exclusively produced outside France.  The company's portfolio also includes Davidoff cigarettes, Golden Virginia loose tobacco and Rizla rolling papers.  In a statement, Imperial which employs 35,000 people in 160 countries, said it was undertaking "a number of restructuring projects to strengthen the groupâs competitive position."  It said the measures, including the two factory closures, would be implemented over the next two years.  "The proposed closures reflect declining industry volumes in Europe, impacted by tough economic conditions, increasing regulation and excise and growth in illicit trade," the statement said.  "Production has been affected at the Nottingham and Nantes sites, which now utilise less than half their manufacturing capacity."  Imperial's chief executive, Alison Cooper, added: "These projects are an essential part of securing the sustainable future of the business.  "The prospect of job losses is always regrettable and we will be doing all we can to support employees and ensure that they are treated in a fair and responsible manner."  The company said the cuts would deliver savings of Â£300 million a year (360 million euros, $500 million) from September 2018.	google

Lung Disease, UPMC Altoona foundations partner for presentation The Lung Disease Foundation of Central Pennsylvania, in partnership with UPMC Altoona Foundation, presented 30 vape sensors to the Altoona Area High School on April 14. The vape sensors will be installed in the restrooms and locker rooms in the Altoona Area High School to detect vape smoke and chemicals. According to the Altoona Area School District, vaping made up 98% of their tobacco violations in 2019-20. Dr. George M. Zlupko, chairman of the Lung Disease Foundation of Central Pennsylvania, senior partner and founder of the Altoona Lung Specialists, said, “The Lung Disease Foundation is pleased to partner with the Altoona Area School District in providing Vape Sensors to help in controlling the epidemic of vaping which is creating serious long-term consequences for students.” In 2015, the U.S. Surgeon General reported that e-cigarette use among high school students had increased by 900%. These products are now the most commonly used form of tobacco among youth in the United States, surpassing conventional tobacco products, including cigarettes, cigars, chewing tobacco, and hookahs. Most e-cigarettes contain nicotine, which can cause addiction and can harm the developing adolescent brain. According to Sherri Stayer, executive director for the Lung Disease Foundation, “There are students as young as 11 and 12 years old being caught with these devices and the sensors will identify youth utilizing the devices and provide for referral to new educational program called INDEPTH “Intervention for Nicotine Dependence: Education, Prevention, Tobacco and Health,” which is an alternative to suspension and citation program. The program will be mandatory upon referral and allow for education of the students on the risks associated with the use of the devices.” As the Tobacco Control Service Provider for Blair and Bedford Counties, the Lung Disease Foundation of Central PA is responsible for providing prevention, education and tobacco cessation programs, as well as working to eliminate exposure to secondhand smoke. It is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit foundation founded by Dr. George M. Zlupko. The foundation is located in the Lung Disease Center of Central PA at 800 Chestnut Ave., Altoona.

153	6f076993-247b-3c0e-8bc1-cf83c1366ac5	New FDA e-cigarette rules leave local fans, foes sharply divided	Now it's extending that authority to cover all tobacco products, like cigars, hookah tobacco and even e-cigarettes.  Jeff Stier, a senior fellow at the National Center for Public Policy Research, complained in a USA Today op-ed that the federal government overreached in its e-cigarette regulations.  In fact, a study jointly supported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the FDA found the use of e-cigarettes by high school students has increased 900 percent from 2011 to 2015.  Previously proposed rules related to electronic cigarettes and other tobacco forms were formally released yesterday.  These include not allowing products to be sold to individuals younger than age 18 years, requiring age verification with photo ID, not allowing the sale of covered tobacco products in vending machines (unless in an adult-only facility), and not permitting the distribution of free samples.  The US government has announced its new federal rules, which include a ban on the sale of e-cigarettes to people under the age of 18.  In California, Democratic Governor Jerry Brown signed five bills to restrict the use of tobacco in various ways, including the regulation of e-cigarettes and the expansion of funds for funding the anti-smoking programmes. "If it's another flavor, that's a different product", said Jensen.  The FDA says the new regulation will allow them to evaluate the ingredients of these products, how they're made and the impact on public health, but many in the vaping industry believe it comes down to money.  Paterno Knew of Sandusky Abuses in 1976: Insurer   A lawsuit between Penn State and an insurance company, Pennsylvania Manufacturer's Association Insurance (PMA). In November, Penn State disclosed that it had settled 32 claims related to Sandusky totalling $93 million.  Congress gave the FDA authority to oversee tobacco products in 2009, but until now the agency had not finalized rules to regulate e-cigarettes and cigars. "There are thousands of small business and tens of thousands of jobs on the line", Conley said. "They will still contain nicotine and vapor, but they'll cost a lot more for consumers and be owned by a few big businesses". "So up until now, we don't know all the ingredients", said Temple.  "Ending the tobacco epidemic is more urgent than ever, and can only happen if the FDA acts aggressively and broadly to protect all Americans from all tobacco products", said Harold Wimmer, president of the American Lung Association.  It said vapor products are a game-changing technology in the campaign to reduce cigarette smoking. Manufacturers will also have to have all of their products tested and approved along with new health warnings.  Stock up on e-cigarettes while you can: As of August, retailers will be prohibited from selling the electronic puffers to minors.  Some have actually touted the e-cigarette as an alternative to traditional cigarettes and as an aid to help smokers quit.	bing										
154	5fe79276-a2de-37a1-bced-7397982691f0	The Labour party pledges tobacco levy if in power next year	MANCHESTER England (Reuters) - The Labour party said on Tuesday it would introduce a U.S.-style "sin tax" on tobacco firms if it wins a national election next year, sending shares in the leading cigarette groups lower on the day.  Labour leader Ed Miliband made the pledge in a speech to his party's annual conference which he hopes will help him persuade sceptical voters he is prime ministerial material and can win power next May.  "We will raise extra resources from the tobacco companies who make soaring profits on the back of ill health," Miliband told party activists.  The tax, would be based on firms' market share and would aim to raise at least 150 million pounds ($245 million), the party said in an advance briefing note.  Shares in British American Tobacco and Imperial Tobacco were both down by 1.7 percent, although shares in both companies had already been trading lower as the broader FTSE 100 index fell 1.4 percent.  Big tobacco companies are already at odds with the British government over plans to implement a law requiring tobacco products to be sold in plain packaging with graphic health warnings and no branding.  The government said in April it was prepared to move forward with the plan, aimed at reducing the lure of smoking for young people. It published draft regulations in June and finished a six-week consultation in August.  Philip Morris has said it is prepared to sue the government should it move forward with such a law, whose implementation in Australia has led that country to face challenges at the World Trade Organization.  Labour are narrowly ahead of Prime Minister David Cameron's Conservative party in the polls, after a lead of up to 10 percentage points slipped over the last 12 months. A YouGov poll released before Miliband's speech on Tuesday put support for Labour at 35 percent against 33 percent for the Conservatives.	bing										
155	eef4d27a-0613-3513-b688-312366560cbc	TAMC TIP: Quit Tobacco	Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of death in the U.S.,  with 443,000 deaths annually. Those subjected to secondhand smoke exposure have a higher risk of heart attacks and cancers. The U.S. Surgeon General has emphasized that there is no safe level of secondhand smoke.  Of particular concern to the Department of Defense is widespread smokeless tobacco use. Studies have shown smokeless tobacco causes oral health problems and cancer.  Every day, Tripler Army Medical Center treats the adverse and costly health effects of tobacco use among its health care beneficiaries.  Health care organizations have a mission to improve the health of individuals and communities they serve.  All service members and beneficiaries can discuss quitting with their health care providers and enlist their friends and family as support. TAMC encourages TRICARE beneficiaries who use tobacco to review resources at the DoD’s tobacco cessation website at www.ucanquit2.org, which is specifically oriented to service members, veterans and families.  For details on smoking cessation classes and programs, contact the primary care manager at 433-2778.	google

As part of the UEFA Respect your Health campaign, this summer's tobacco-free EURO will go one step further than any of UEFA's previous tournaments, with volunteers and stewards trained to ensure that spectators are made aware of the policy and the need to comply with it at all times. Anyone caught using tobacco or e-cigarettes once they have passed through the turnstiles will be asked to stop.  Over 6,500 people are volunteering at UEFA EURO 2016. All the volunteers involved in the Respect your Health campaign are receiving training on the no-tobacco policy through a purpose-built e-learning platform, an app and situational group sessions. The training, which coincides with World No Tobacco Day, is also being rolled out among security managers and stewards.  UEFA worked with the European Healthy Stadia Network and the World Heart Federation to develop its no-tobacco policy for UEFA EURO 2016. Tobacco use is the largest preventable cause of premature death and chronic disease around the world, and it causes over 700,000 deaths a year in Europe alone.  The main reason smoking will not be allowed at UEFA EURO 2016 is to protect fans and staff from the dangers of second-hand smoke – a direct cause of disease, disability and death. Other reasons include setting a good example to young people, minimising fire hazards and contributing to a tournament that promotes health and enjoyment for all.  Respect your Health is one of the eight social responsibility and sustainability priorities defined for UEFA EURO 2016, all of which featured in the tournament’s one-year to go report. More information on the eight priorities and the report is available here.  The strengthening of UEFA's policy on tobacco consumption and promotion is a natural step in its ongoing commitment to using football to promote healthy lifestyles and a safe, sustainable environment for all.	bing

This was the department’s second sting operation under the Department of Justice Law Enforcement Tobacco Prevention and Enforcement Grant. “The goal of this portion of the program is to gain 100% legal compliance from retailers to sell tobacco and nicotine products to only people 21 years of age or older,” explains Susanville Police Captain Ryan Cochran. Current law prohibits a person or retailer to sell tobacco products to a person under the age of 21. “The decoy program consists of using a person under the age of 21 years of age to purchase tobacco products. If asked by the retailer, the minor decoy tells them their true age and if requested, provides their true identification. The decoy is monitored and observed at all times by SPD Officers.” The department’s Enforcement Team visited the Smokin’ Bean, Dollar General, Walmart, Safeway and Mobil Gas/Mini Mart. According to Cochran all of the retailers successfully rejected the minor decoy’s request by either asking their age or viewing their identification. “We are pleased that we had 100% compliance from the retailers that were visited. The Susanville Police Department has been working hard on educating our local retailers on the new laws regarding tobacco sales. This operation shows the education is working in our community. Congratulations to all the retailers. Keep up the good work.” Posted by Jeremy on . Filed under Local & Regional News. You can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0.

158	ce7fc997-83e9-3480-bdab-072a2dc10b8d	Dupuy: E-cigarettes should be e-regulated - Summit Daily News	Let me get one thing out of the way: I hate cigarette smoke. Hate isn’t even a strong enough word for my violent contempt for smoking. It’s twofold: Smokers stink up common air and often litter common space. When people in public parks flick their butts on walkways they cede their civil rights and we should be able to water board them in the fountain.  And yes, I’m a reformed smoker and a total hypocrite. I smoked like a rendering plant from the time I was a young teenager until I was nearly 30. I attribute my stopping to draconian and fascistic public policy: I couldn’t smoke in restaurants; I couldn’t smoke in bars; in some states I couldn’t smoke 100 feet from said establishments. It got more and more expensive as normally tax-resistant politicians taxed the hack out of my vice. Smoking made me a social pariah.  It was no longer fun nor chic nor dignified so I quit.  In quitting smoking I also ended my life-long love affair with nicotine. For those of you unfamiliar, it’s a delectable drug that stimulates brain function, decreases appetite and calms nerves. And then after years of dependence it makes you think it’s akin to oxygen, and the notion of being without it sends you into a panic. As an irony to this soothing and comforting drug, long-term use of nicotine means you’re rarely ever calm. So to me quitting smoking only to chew nicotine gum is a lateral move. All the health benefits and financial motivations of not smoking are null and void if you are still on nicotine.  Enter e-cigarettes. First off no one would ever brag about how they quit smoking pot and only vaporize now. They’d still be considered a pothead (or Maureen Dowd). But we have these distinctions with nicotine. People can believe they’ve quit smoking cigarettes and chew, patch or vape instead. Legally e-cigarettes have slipped under the radar — evident by the television commercials and advertisement space not available to other tobacco products for at least a decade.  Now a group of 53 scientists with the blessing of Big Tobacco are pleading with the U.N.’s World Health Organization not to classify e-cigarettes as tobacco products because it will save lives. The argument is that if people switch to vaporizing tobacco it’s healthier, so the electronic version of cigarettes should continue to be unregulated.  This is complicated for me. I can be in a car with all the windows rolled up and drive by someone smoking a cigarette and get annoyed because I smell smoke. Conversely if someone sitting right next to me puffs away on an e-cig I can’t detect it, let alone care. As someone who finds cruel and unusual punishment appropriate for smokers — I don’t have the same passion for vaporized nicotine.  Laws like the one in my state banning e-cigarettes in restaurants and bars just seem arbitrary and knee-jerk against something that looks like smoking. Would we back a law that banned chewing nicotine gum on airplanes? Perhaps. Would people comply? Nope. Then the law exists only for lawmakers’ catharsis and not for any real public health benefit.  However I am grateful that public shaming motivated me to get off nicotine for good. I’m happy there was an austere, punitive and totally unfair tax to disincentivize smoking. I think it’s a horrible pointless addiction I’d only wish on people I don’t like (smokers, for example).  Here’s where my conflict is: I don’t like nicotine but don’t think my opinion of a drug should mean it’s unavailable to others to enjoy. Even if that drug is admittedly carcinogenic. Sure, e-cigarettes are harmful to public health, but obesity is also a wide public health crisis and I’m not going to support a ban on beige food. I can personally find things other people do to be objectionable and not try to stop them. It’s only when it seeps into my space where there’s an issue of contention. So I’m OK with e-cigarettes being allowed in places you can’t smoke in.  That being said, e-cigarettes should be classified as tobacco. Yes they’re technically a “nicotine delivery device” derived from tobacco. For all intents and purposes — it’s tobacco. They should have to abide by the same laws as other tobacco products. They should be taxed just like other tobacco products. The FDA should regulate them just like other tobacco products and the WHO should categorize them just like other tobacco products.  Vaping should be a healthier option for nicotine — not a gaping loophole.

159	3f71c011-1879-37b4-97a9-2287b3773c78	Off the hook: smoking – and how to give it up	However, it is possible to come off, and stay off, cigarettes. A French study of 233 smokers with HIV found that about 7% stopped within the next two years.  This quit rate is approximately what Carolina Herberts sees at the Royal Free.  “We know that about 3% of patients a year, who simply decide to stop and have no other help, manage to quit permanently after any one attempt.  “If they also use medication such as nicotine replacement therapy or the anti-smoking drugs Zyban (bupropion) or Champix, the one-year success rate is 7%. But if they get medication and support, such as an anti-smoking course, the success rate is 20%.”  Short-term success is much greater: a month after stopping smoking 60% of smokers have still stopped. But, as I found, the addictiveness of nicotine means that there’s a high relapse rate.  Vince knows about relapse. He’s 64, has had HIV for 23 years, and used to smoke 30 a day. A tough proposition for a stop-smoking course.  “I started smoking at 17, and was smoking for 38 years before I stopped in 2000,” he says. “I managed to stay smoke-free till last year when I was having a bad time.  “I started again in June and was soon up to 30 a day. I was coughing again within a month. A friend said: ‘You’re already sounding like you did ten years ago’.”  The first time round he had attended a stop-smoking course at the Royal London Hospital. He initially tried nicotine replacement therapy but, finding it didn’t work, started taking Zyban.  It’s still not clear exactly how Zyban works. It has tended to become less popular over time – in favour of Champix – because a lot of people complain of side-effects, including Vince. “I felt really spaced out, like I was unpleasantly drunk and had a woolly mind. However they halved the dose and I then felt much better.”  This may have been because anti-HIV drugs, including both protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside (NNRTI) drugs, increase the amount of Zyban in the body.  This time round he tried the GMFA stop-smoking course and Champix. This is the first drug specifically designed as an anti-smoking medication. It works by blocking the nicotine receptors on nerve cells, so smokers experience fewer cravings when they stop. It doesn’t interact with HIV drugs.  The most common side effect is mild nausea in the first couple of weeks. Vince also experienced disturbing dreams and disrupted sleep, though he says “it was hard to tell if it was part of the mental process of giving up.” And he says it has not entirely abolished cravings. But at the time I interviewed him, five weeks after the stop-smoking course, he only admitted to once having a puff on a tobacco-free marijuana joint.  Only a minority take an anti-smoking pill; the most popular choice is still to use nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), which gives you a hit of nicotine without filling you full of the tar and carbon monoxide you would get from smoking a cigarette.  NRT comes in a variety of different guises, tailored to smokers’ individual habits. Habitual smokers who light up first thing in the morning might use patches, which deliver a regular supply of nicotine. Occasional smokers might benefit more from gum, fast-acting lozenges, or a nicotine nasal spray to tackle cravings.  Milo is another GMFA course graduate. He’s 35 and HIV-negative and saw his cigarette consumption increase to about 15 a day since he started smoking eleven years ago. He had tried to give up three times before he decided to try a course.  “I think the course really helped; sharing experiences, going through something similar to everyone else. If you relapse you’re letting others down as well as yourself – though I liked the honesty of it too, and people feeling able to admit their slip-ups. It’s the first group therapy thing I’ve ever done.”  Vince chose the GMFA course because “courses are the only thing that have ever worked for me. It’s the ego thing, being able to come back the following few weeks and tell people you’re smoke-free.”  He wants to stay a non-smoker “because it’s the one thing in my life I can control. I need meds for my HIV, and I take antidepressants too. At least I can bloody well stop cigarettes. And I want to stay alive for my partner Ray.”  Barrie Dwyer emphasises there is no disgrace in relapse. “Most smokers need a lot of attempts before they quit successfully. If it doesn’t work this time, come back!”	bing										
160	25de98c7-1530-30ac-9090-3b11296c0dd1	A Tobacco Tax Increase In Ontario Will Fund Organized Crime - Exchange Morning Post (press release)	OTTAWA  Yesterday, the National Coalition Against Contraband Tobacco (NCACT) warns the province of Ontario that an increase in provincial tobacco taxes will fuel Ontario’s booming illegal cigarette industry. This will fund organized crime endangering the safety of communities in Ontario. “There is already more contraband tobacco in Ontario than any other province, operated largely by organized crime,” said Gary Grant, a 39-year veteran of the Toronto Police Service and national spokesperson for the NCACT. “Already, a ‘baggie’ of 200 illegal cigarettes can cost as little as $8; more than $70 less than the price of legal product. A tax increase only makes this difference wider, and the criminal market more lucrative.” The RCMP estimates that there are about 175 criminal gangs that use the trade to finance their other illegal activities, including guns, drugs and human smuggling. Ontario has done little in recent years to tackle contraband tobacco, despite having made commitments in the past to consider tougher measures, including in the last two provincial budgets. “Ontario’s lack of action has given the criminals that run the contraband tobacco industry free reign for too long. In contrast, tougher police powers in Quebec have allowed for more robust police action. Look at the Montreal example. Today, a major illegal cigarette bust was announced, with dozens of arrests tying contraband tobacco directly to the organized crime ring,” continued Grant. “If Ontario was serious about contraband tobacco, we’d see more arrests like those in Quebec, and not actions that will effectively fund organized crime.” “We need to keep our communities safe. We need strong measures to eliminate this growing problem in Ontario,” conclude Grant. “Higher taxes that increase the price gap on tobacco do exactly the opposite.”	google

162	533fbf28-49b3-393d-a56f-3d00605368c0	Federal Government Sends Warning To Vaping Companies	Two U.S. government agencies are warning companies that sell vaping products that their packaging resembles candy and may be in violation of safety and marketing guidelines because of its possible appeal to teens and children. Food and Drug Administration Listen Listening... / Originally published on May 2, 2018 5:25 am The Food and Drug Administration and Federal Trade Commission on Tuesday sent warning letters to 13 manufacturers, distributors and retailers of e-cigarette liquids. In a phone briefing for reporters, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said the companies are endangering kids by marketing the products to resemble juice boxes, cookies or candy. "You look at the lollipop for example. I don't see how my 4- or 5-year-old doesn't just look at that and see a lollipop. It's a lollipop," he said. E-liquids are used in electronic cigarettes, and they often use nicotine which can cause illness — even death — if ingested by a small child. Products targeted have names like Smurf Sauce and V'Nilla Cookies & Milk. "These are being deliberately designed in ways that they can be just mistakenly confused by a child," Gottlieb said in the briefing. The agencies cited recent national data of thousands of nicotine exposures in kids younger than 6, who accidentally ingested the vaping liquid. The letters and violations vary somewhat by company but, overall, the letters say the products' appeal to minors violates parts of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, which gives the FDA authority over marketing and distributing tobacco products. "Today's announcement should send a clear signal that companies selling these products have a responsibility to insure they aren't putting children in harm's way or enticing youth use," Gottlieb said. He warned more actions would be coming. Jameson Rodgers is vice president of business development for California-based NEwhere Inc., one of the companies that received a letter. He says his company's products are only for adults who want to switch to vaping from traditional cigarettes, which he says are less healthful. The FDA targeted the company's One Mad Hit Juice Box e-liquid. Rodgers says the company voluntarily removed it from distribution last year. "We definitely didn't intend to position it as a product that would appeal to anybody who wasn't of legal smoking age," he says, though he admits it might have sent a "questionable" message. "Really would you buy a product, a vape with the name Dancing Monkey or Cotton Candy? At the end of the day we're trying to create products that have the ability to compete against Big Tobacco," he says. According to its website, TVECA is a nonprofit dedicated to "create a sensible and responsible electronic cigarette market" by providing education, communication and research to media, lawmakers and consumers. Tuesday's warning letters are part of a larger push by the federal government to crack down on youth access to tobacco products, including vaping. Last week the FDA sent a warning letter to 40 retail stores for selling the e-cigarette brand Juul to minors. They also asked the company for research on its appeal to children and teenagers. Health officials say Juul is highly addictive, and it's so new there's scant research about its health effects. The companies targeted Tuesday have 15 days to respond — to either defend their practices or explain how they'll change their labeling, or risk federal action such as fines or prosecution. This story is part of a reporting partnership with NPR, Colorado Public Radio and Kaiser Health News.	webhose.io

[USA], Apr 4 (ANI): In a recent study, researchers have shown that regulations on smokeless tobacco are still lacking, despite 181 countries agreeing to a common approach to controlling the demand and supply.The study, published in The Lancet Oncology, highlighted that of the 181 countries using the World Health Organization (WHO) Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), only 138 define smokeless tobacco in their statutes and 34 countries have so far reported levying a tax on smokeless tobacco products.Just six countries check and regulate the content of smokeless tobacco products while only 41 mandate pictorial health warnings on these products.Professor Kamran Siddiqi, from the University of York's Department of Health Sciences, said, "Smokeless tobacco is particularly popular in Asia and Africa and includes chewing tobacco as well as various types of nasal tobacco."They contain high levels of nicotine as well as cancer producing toxic chemicals, making head and neck cancers common in those who consume smokeless tobacco products," he added."Women are a particularly high-risk group, as cigarette smoking is less socially acceptable in females in parts of Asia and Africa, resulting in smokeless tobacco being a popular alternative," he pointed."We found that there is a policy implementation gap in smokeless tobacco control, highlighting the need for increased global efforts to reduce the use of the products to catch-up with the progress made in curbing cigarette consumption," he added.Researchers are now working to establish a new global health group to address smokeless tobacco use in South Asia. The team will bring together researchers from around the world to critically assess policy and develop interventions to address the problems caused by smokeless tobacco, particularly in India, Bangladesh and Pakistan.Professor Ravi Mehrotra, Director of the Indian Council of Medical Research's National Institute of Cancer Prevention and Research (ICMR-NICPR), India, said, "Smokeless tobacco use is a public health concern in Southeast Asia, and beyond and requires a comprehensive approach to deal with the challenges identified in this study.""The WHO FCTC Global Knowledge Hub on Smokeless Tobacco at ICMR-NICPR is committed to assisting in implementing the key recommendations in order to reduce the significant health burden," Mehrotra said.

165	28a27d65-140e-3e19-b79c-4f980aae8028	Tobacco use accelerates transmission of COVID-19, says Health Ministry	The chemicals in tobacco smoke suppress the activity of different types of immune cells that are involved in general and targeted immune responses. Tobacco use accelerates transmission of COVID-19, says Health Ministry&nbsp | &nbspPhoto Credit:&nbspiStock Images New Delhi: Smokers are likely to be more vulnerable to COVID-19 as smoking increases possibility of transmission of virus from hand to mouth, the Union Health Ministry has said, warning that use of tobacco products can increase severity of respiratory infections and make people susceptible to coronavirus. In its document 'COVID-19 Pandemic and Tobacco Use in India', the ministry said experts have confirmed that smokers are more likely to develop severe symptoms or die from COVID-19, as it primarily attacks the lungs and warned against use of any such products. Smokers, it warned, are likely to be more vulnerable to COVID-19 as the act of smoking means that fingers (and possibly contaminated cigarettes) are in contact with lips which increases the possibility of transmission of virus from hand to mouth. "Further smoking products such as water pipes or hookah often involve the sharing of mouth-pieces and hoses, which could facilitate the transmission of COVID-19 in communal and social settings," the ministry said. Tobacco use is a major risk factor for the four main Non-communicable Diseases (NCDs) cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic lung disease and diabetes, which puts people with these conditions at higher risk for developing severe illness when affected by COVID-19. NCDs are estimated to account for 63 pc of all deaths in India and these are expected to rise further. The chemicals in tobacco smoke suppress the activity of different types of immune cells that are involved in general and targeted immune responses. "Smoking impairs lung function, thereby reducing the immunity and making it harder for the body to fight off various diseases. Smoking, e-cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, pan masala and the like products use can increase risk and severity of pulmonary infections because of damage to upper airways and a decrease in pulmonary immune function," it said. Evidence from countries reporting coronavirus infection related fatalities has highlighted that the people with pre-existing non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are more susceptible to becoming severely ill with COVID-19, the document stated. Tobacco use poses a significant risk by accelerating the transmission of COVID-19 because the virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Chewing tobacco products (khaini, gutkha, paan, zarda) increases the urge to spit. Spitting in public places increases health risks especially those of spreading the infectious and contagious diseases like, COVID-19, tuberculosis, swine flu, encephalitis, etc, the ministry underlined. "The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare warns against the use of any tobacco products," it said, adding within 12 hours of quitting, the carbon monoxide level in the bloodstream drops to normal. Within 2-12 weeks, circulation improves and lung function increases. After 1-9 months, coughing and shortness of breath decreases, it said. For full coverage on Coronavirus pandemic, click here.

The text had already been approved in negotiations with member states and EU officials and it will now be rapidly approved into law. The ban comes into effect from 2021. EU Commission Vice-President Frans Timmermans said Europe was not the worst source of plastic pollution, but that the pioneering measure could serve as an example to the world. "Asian countries are very much interested in what we're doing. Latin American countries too," he said. "Even though our share of the pollution is relatively limited, our change of the economic model has a global impact." The law passed by 560 votes to 35 in the Strasbourg assembly. Aside from the ban on a dozen kinds of disposable products for which alternatives exist, the EU will encourage member states to reduce the use of plastic packaging and introduce stricter labelling rules. The law sets a target that 90 percent of plastic bottles will be gathered for recycling by 2029 and that they should be produced with 25 percent recycled material by 2025, 30 percent by 2030. Rules insisting that polluters pay the costs of a clean-up are strengthened, particularly for cigarette manufacturers, who will have to support the recycling of discarded filters. According to the EU Commission, the products prohibited under the law represent 70 percent of the waste that pours into the world's oceans, posing a threat to wildlife and fisheries.	webhose.io

170	195e81e5-1ff5-3e68-ae81-3b3ddae683bc	While Waiting for Anti-Tobacco Law: Cameroon Coalition Against Tobacco Pushes On With Aggressive Sensitization	The figures above are so frightening that the Cameroon Coalition Against Tobacco (C3T) headed by Dr Flore Ndembiyembe is bent on mitigating the rate of Tobacco consumption in the country through aggressive sensitization. For this reason, C3T on Tuesday September 23 gathered the media to discuss the quality of tobacco control in Cameroon as well as communication and commercialization strategies adopted by tobacco companies in modern times.  During the meeting, the coalition demonstrated how several tobacco brands uses psychology and social context to woo more victims. According to C3T findings, the same way alcohol manufacturers have invented sugary cocktails to get adolescent accustomed to the taste of alcohol, cigarette companies have invented cigarette “sweet” or “bonbon”.  “These bonbons are also dangerous to health as cigarette itself,” C3T warns.  Furthermore, tobacco industries are devising other means of wooing potential smokers. These include but not limited to aggressive use of the almost uncontrollable social media, clothing of  young and attractive ladies in their brand’s T-shirts as well as the distribution of their communication gadgets to people in big cities with the ultimate goal of selling their brand and wooing new customers.  All these, the Cameroon Coalition Against Tobacco insists is against the December 2006 law governing advertisement in Cameroon. Article 39 of the law clearly stipulates that advertisements for cigarettes and other tobacco products are prohibited in the press whether by means of radio broadcasting, television broadcasting, display advertising, film or any other similar means. The prohibition also applies to any form of sponsorship or patronage highlighting cigarettes and other tobacco products, as well as cross-border advertising engineered from within the Cameroonian territory.  Since Cameroon became a signatory to the World Health Organisation Framework Convention for Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) in May 2006, several actions have been taken by the Ministry of Public Health and the civil society for the adoption of an anti-tobacco law. C3T regrets that the anti-tobacco law proposal has lingered at the presidency for too long.  According Dr Flore Ndembiyembe, one of the key actors pushing for the adoption of that law, several measures have been taken by the state to reduce the effects of tobacco in the society but the tobacco industry seemed not bordered by these measures. She pursues that Cameroon is under pressure from the tobacco industry reason why the state continues to subsidies tobacco cultivation.  The organisation says out of 6 million tobacco-related deaths globally every year, 80 per cent occurred in the developing world, mainly in Africa where tobacco consumption swelled by 4.3 per cent annually. “Only simple, clear rigorous laws, which are possible to respect, will guarantee the public’s power to benefit from pure air without tobacco smoke,” Ndembiyembe insists.	bing

Kate Bratskeir Food and Health Editor, The Huffington Post Want to stamp those butts out for good (please say yes)? Cold turkey is the way to go. According to a new study published in Annals of Internal Medicine, people who abruptly quit smoking were 25 percent more likely to be cigarette-free six months later, when compared to smokers who attempted to gradually give up the habit.  Researchers at the University of Oxford examined 700 long-term smokers in England who wanted to quit. Half of the smokers were instructed to pick a day to give up the habit and stick with it. The other half were told to gradually cut back on smoking for two weeks leading up to their quit day. Both groups were given nicotine patches to use in the days leading up to their respective quit days. Afterward, both were also provided patches and counseling.  A month after their quit dates, 49 percent of the cold turkey group had kept from smoking, compared to 39.2 percent of the gradual-quit group. Six months after their quit dates, 22 percent of the cold turkey group was not smoking, compared to 15.5 percent of the gradual group. While success rates were better for the cold turkey group, Nicola Lindson-Hawley, lead study author and a postdoctoral researcher at the Oxford in England said both results were impressive.  "Health care workers should offer abrupt quitting first , but if that is not an option, gradual quitting can be a second-line show," she said in a statement, CNN reported. "We understand that people might be dead set against quitting abruptly so if the only way they would consider quitting is gradually then the results of this trial suggest it shouldn’t be ruled out." The researcher also said that those wanting to quit should seek support from products and people known to help. "There is a lot of evidence to suggest that if you would like to quit the best way to do so is by seeking help in the form of behavioral counseling and a treatment such as nicotine replacement therapy or varenicline," she said, Reuters reported. "However, there are also benefits of calling quitlines, particularly if these go on to provide proactive support for quitters."  Lindson-Hawley theorizes that the cold turkey method works better because, in essence, it's ripping off the bandaid in one fell swoop. "In the gradual group, because they were put through it in a gradual way, they lost the motivation ," she said.  Also on HuffPost Natural Ways To Quit Smoking Natural Ways To Quit Smoking 1 5 Mindfulness Mindfulness training helped participants in a 2011 Drug and Alcohol Dependence study to stay off cigarettes.   That study included 88 people who smoked 20 cigarettes daily, on average, who were split up into two groups: One received four weeks of mindfulness training, while the other group went through four weeks of an American Lung Association stop-smoking program .   The researchers found that more of those who went through the mindfulness training smoked fewer cigarettes -- and stayed off them -- than those who went through the other stop-smoking program.   The mindfulness training included realizing when you're facing a craving , accepting it, thinking about what's happening and then taking note of the sensation (whether it's tightness or pressure), Psychology Today reported.

Researchers who carried out a detailed study found around five million adults have attempted to stop smoking in the last year, but one in five didn’t even last a month. And half of those who tried blamed a lack of willpower for their failure to kick nicotine. Despite not being able to pack them in for good, one third of users said they were able to cut back by more than 75 per cent while one quarter halved their intake by using alternatives. The study by V2 Cigs UK also found six per cent of those quizzed defended their habit by claiming they were merely ‘social smokers’. Of those attempting to quit, the cold turkey approach was deemed the most popular method by one in three survey respondents, A further two in five have found alternatives to distract themselves and one in five roped a fellow smoker in to help them quit together. Over two thirds blamed their lack of ability to quit on a lack of sleep. The most common reason (61 per cent) for quitting among survey respondents was to be healthier, followed by 13 per cent who wanted to save money. A startling five per cent only quit because they contracted a smoking-related illness. Paul Hunt, Managing Director of V2 Cigs UK, said: “It’s good to see that so many people have decided to give vaping a go. ”It’s been widely researched and found that it can be significantly helpful for those trying to quit smoking for good. “Many people have never even tried e-cigarettes because they’re worried about their safety and how addictive they are. ”But it’s important to realise how much of a safer alternative vaping is than smoking, as e-cigarette contain significantly fewer cancer-causing chemicals. ”However, credit goes to the one in five who have quit and managed to stay smoke-free or those attempting Stoptober – the NHS’ month-long campaign, which has driven a million quit attempts to date.” One fifth of Brits who took part in the study by www.buyv2cigs.co.uk say they’ve tried picking up a vape pen in a bid to dampen the death-sticks – and the number is quickly catching up on the quarter who smoke traditional cigarettes. According to Action on Smoking and Health, the number of people vaping has quadrupled in the last five years. But smoking isn’t the only bad habit that is dwelling on the nation’s minds, as 59 per cent admit they drink alcohol at least once a week, while 38 per cent confess to nibbling their nails and 10 per cent, sucking their thumbs. Healthy habits seem to be becoming a popular distraction, with 59 per cent of those polled taking up jogging, dieting or meditation to curb their cravings, while 53 per cent can be found in the gym.

175	c6010a15-4ca2-3d5c-80d4-a11049933e73	Long-term varenicline treatment supports tobacco abstinence in people with mental illness	Extended treatment with the smoking cessation drug varenicline (Chantix) significantly improved the ability of individuals with serious mental illness to maintain abstinence from tobacco after a standard 12-week course of treatment. In this Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) study – the first randomized, controlled trial of maintenance pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation in such patients – participants who quit smoking and then received varenicline along with cognitive behavioral therapy for an additional 40 weeks were three times more successful in maintaining abstinence from smoking than those who received cognitive behavioral therapy and a placebo drug.  "We know that relapsing to smoking is a big problem for smokers without psychiatric illness, but relapsing after a course of smoking cessation medication appears to happen even more rapidly in those with schizophrenia and related disorders," says Eden Evins, MD, MPH, director of the MGH Center for Addiction Medicine and lead author of the report in the Jan. 8 Journal of the American Medical Association. "Maintenance therapy to help these patients sustain abstinence could reduce an important source of stigma, along with their heavy burden of smoking-related illness."  The authors note that, although the rate of smoking among U.S. adults has dropped more than 50 percent since the mid-1960s, the current prevalence of smoking among those with serious mental illness is even higher than it was among the general population in 1965. Half of those who smoke and don't quit will die of a smoking-related illness. Although the majority of individuals with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder smoke tobacco, adults with serious mental illness are rarely offered even a 12-week course of smoking cessation medication. In fact, Evins notes, MassHealth – the Massachusetts Medicaid program – does not reimburse mental health care providers for behavioral smoking cessation treatment services.  One small, uncontrolled study conducted at MGH suggested that an additional 40 weeks of cessation medication treatment could significantly cut the relapse rate among those with serious mental illness. The current study was designed to carefully evaluate whether extended varenicline and cognitive behavioral therapy help maintain the success of patients who achieve abstinence after an initial 12-week cessation program. Participants currently being treated for schizophrenia, for a related condition called schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder enrolled in the study at 10 mental health centers in six states.  After the initial 12-week cessation phase, during which all participants received daily doses of varenicline and weekly group cognitive behavioral therapy sessions, 87 of the original 203 participants (42 percent) were considered to be abstinent. Those individuals were randomized to either continued varenicline or a placebo during the 40-week relapse prevention phase. Both groups continued to receive cognitive behavioral therapy on a schedule of declining frequency during the prevention phase, at the end of which all smoking cessation therapies were discontinued.  At the end of the yearlong study period, 60 percent of participants who received varenicline during the relapse prevention phase were abstinent, based on both self-reporting and on measured levels of exhaled carbon monoxide. Only 19 percent of the placebo group were abstinent at this point. While half of those in the placebo group had relapsed within 35 days of discontinuing varenicline, it took almost a year for half of those in the varenicline group to relapse. Although continued cognitive behavioral therapy was not enough to prevent relapse in the placebo group, the fact that those in the varenicline group who did relapse tended to do so after cognitive behavioral therapy was reduced to a monthly schedule suggests that it may have a role in supporting the benefits of drug therapy.  "Our study showed that cognitive behavioral therapy alone is not enough to help smokers with serious mental illness maintain the abstinence they achieved with a program combining both therapies," Evins explains. "Since we don't know yet how well varenicline would work without cognitive behavioral therapy, we would recommend that these patients be offered both therapies together to support smoking cessation and continued abstinence. Additional studies are needed to evaluate combinations of pharmacotherapy with less intensive behavioral support – like telephone quit lines – and to determine whether other smoking cessation drugs like bupropion would work as well for maintenance treatment."  	bing

The proportion of adults who have ever used e-cigarettes rose from about 3 percent to 8 percent from 2010 to 2012. But there was no significant change last year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study. The study's conclusions seem to parallel a modest decline in e-cigarette sales during the same period that have been noted in analyst reports. The findings come from an annual survey of thousands of adults. It has been the CDC's only source on e-cigarette trends since the devices started selling in the U.S. in late 2006. E-cigarettes are battery-powered devices that produce an odorless vapor that typically contains nicotine, and sometimes flavorings. They are often described as a less dangerous alternative to regular cigarettes, one that may help smokers quit. But e-cigarettes are not yet regulated by the federal government, and there hasn't been much research on them completed yet. "The long-term public health impact of these products is uncertain," study's lead author, Brian King said Wednesday. But he called the leveling off in adults who have ever tried e-cigarettes "a positive note." The study also found the percentage of adults who are described as current e-cigarette smokers — that is, they said they'd used one at least one in the previous 30 days — has been hovering at around 2 percent. Roughly 75 percent of current e-cigarette users said they also smoked regular cigarettes — and that figure hasn't changed much in the four years of the survey. That finding "raises serious questions about whether this product is really helping people quit," said Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. E-cigarettes come in a range of shapes and sizes, and Myers said it's not clear the study's participants would have counted things like "vape pens," ''e-hookahs" and "tanks" as e-cigarettes. But other research suggests most users would include them, King said. The study was released last week by the medical journal, Nicotine & Tobacco Research. ___ AP Tobacco Writer Michael Felberbaum in Richmond, Virginia, contributed to this report.

177	e74de9ad-6fae-3899-9974-8d1959ce5131	The Regulation of E-Cigarettes: Trying to Fit a Square Peg Into a Round Hole?	Electronic cigarettes (or e-cigarettes) have been making big news lately. It seems many of our favourite celebs are making the switch from traditional cigarettes to the less-stinky alternative, and "e-cigarette" lounges, or "vaporiums", are all the rage in New York and other U.S. cities.  Indeed, e-cigarettes may just be the catalyst for the largest public health debate of 2014.  As reported in the New York Times, the e-cigarette market has grown to around $1.7 billion in sales in the United States alone, and some are projecting that e-cigarette sales will beat out sales of regular cigarettes in the next decade.  As with many new things, the apparent widespread use of e-cigarettes is raising a number of questions: Are they making smoking "cool" again, and if so, will they lead to a new generation of smokers? Are they safe? And my personal favourite: how should they be regulated?  The issue as I see it: e-cigarettes do not fit neatly within any existing regulatory scheme (square peg, round hole). This has resulted in a significant gray area, or as some are calling it, the 'wild west'.  And to be clear, living in the "wild west" is not necessarily a good thing.  It is estimated that there are over 250 different e-cigarette brands available in the United States today. Undoubtedly, there is a wide range in the quality of these products, and the chemicals that each contains. Without regulation of this industry, consumers are essentially putting blind faith in manufacturers, and the reputation of the industry as a whole is tied to its weakest link.  Governments around the world are grappling with how to regulate e-cigarettes (just this week, the European Union announced it would regulate the industry) and manufacturers and consumers are awaiting the results with bated breath.  The Current Rules in Canada and the United States  Health Canada has made its position on e-cigarettes clear: e-cigarettes containing nicotine cannot be sold or advertised in Canada without Health Canada approval.  Depending on the amount of nicotine delivered "per dosage unit", e-cigarettes are regulated as either drugs or natural health products. In either case, Health Canada requires pre-marketing evidence of safety, quality and efficacy in connection with intended use.  Like Health Canada, the FDA regulates e-cigarettes that are marketed for therapeutic purposes as drugs and/or devices. Unlike Health Canada, however, the FDA has not yet claimed jurisdiction over e-cigarettes that contain nicotine, as long as they do not claim a health-related use.  As a result, e-cigarettes containing nicotine are being widely marketed and sold throughout the United States, with no rules or regulation about their manufacture or sale - talk about the wild west!  Separately, the FDA regulates tobacco, which currently includes cigarettes, cigarette tobacco, roll-your-own tobacco and smokeless tobacco. The agency has announced it has a proposed rule which will allow it to regulate "additional categories of tobacco products". It is widely suspected that this will bring e-cigarettes under the umbrella by which the sale and advertising of tobacco is controlled.  The FDA's proposed rule is currently before the Office of Management and Budget for review. It was believed that the proposed rule would be released for public comment back in October but still, we wait.  If the FDA regulates e-cigarettes as tobacco, advertising would likely be tightly regulated (if not outright banned) and we may see a prohibition on flavoured juice. In addition, we could see taxes levied, restrictions on where e-cigarettes can be sold and to who, and the requirement to include warnings on labels.  Regulation in this way may alleviate concerns about e-cigarettes becoming the gateway for new (teenaged) smokers (assuming the requisite links can be established).  However, regulation of e-cigarettes as tobacco products may do nothing to ensure the safety of the product. For example, who will control how and where the liquid in e-cigarettes is made?  Drugs and similar products must be manufactured and sold in accordance with strict good manufacturing practices. These requirements ensure (among other things), the quality of products, that they are produced in sanitary conditions with appropriate materials, and that there are processes in place for recalls if needed. Essentially, production and quality are controlled. These controls would likely need to be more stringent in the case of e-cigarettes, in comparison to traditional tobacco products.  Health Canada has provided no indication of how it will regulate e-cigarettes in the future. It may follow the FDA's (assumed) lead and pull them under the umbrella of tobacco regulation, or it may continue to regulate them under the Food and Drugs Act as either drugs or natural health products.  While regulating e-cigarettes as tobacco may not make sense, it may be equally nonsensical to regulate them as drugs or natural health products.  In particular, it may be difficult for a health-related regulatory body to fold a 'smoking product' into its mandate of promoting health and safety, even if e-cigarettes are safe and contribute to getting folks off cancer-causing traditional cigarettes. This is particularly so, given the industry's apparent lack of interest in marketing e-cigarettes as nicotine replacement therapies (like the Nicorette inhaler, patch or gum).  And so, as I see it, the real issue with the regulation of e-cigarettes is that the product does not fit neatly into an existing regulatory category -- square peg, round hole.  It may make the most sense to take the relevant elements of the two existing regimes (drug and tobacco) and create a category-specific regulatory regime specifically designed for what looks to be one of the biggest up-and-coming products of the next decade. Health Canada has done this before, most notably, with the introduction of the Natural Health Product Regulations to govern "herbal remedies" in 2004.      Whichever way you slice it, there is no question that the e-cigarette industry is innovative and that nicotine is big business (just think of all the upcoming New Year's resolutions!). There will continue to be demand for this product, and industry will figure out a way to get it into the hands (and mouths) of consumers.  But they too want to make sure it's done smartly. The reputable e-cigarette manufacturers want regulation to ensure that fly-by-night operations do not kill the industry.  The key is making sure regulation ensures the safety of the product and imposes the most appropriate rules around its marketing and advertising. In order to accomplish this, lawmakers will need to acknowledge that e-cigarettes are neither drugs nor tobacco products is necessary. Simply put: there is no way to reasonably fit a square peg into a round hole.	bing

But the World Health Organisation (WHO) now has serious questions to answer about its months of complacency over ebola. WHO’s director-general, Margaret Chan, made a speech only two weeks ago implying that tobacco control and the fight against e-cigarettes is a more important issue.  On October 13 Dr Chan gave her apologies for not being able to attend a conference on ebola and made a speech instead at a WHO summit in Moscow on tobacco. This is what she	google										
179	5453117a-fbc9-3761-95a8-feb70367fcff	Champix Linked to Heart Risk in Study	A study published in the latest issue of the Canadian Medical Association Journal (CMAJ) has raked up doubts over the safety profile of the smoking-cessation drug Champix/Chantix (varenicline), developed and marketed by US pharma major Pfizer. The study was conducted by researchers from the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine (US), the University of East Anglia (UK) and the Wake Forest University (US) with part-funding from the National Center for Research Resources (NCRR), a unit of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH). The methodology involves meta analyses of 14 selected double-blind randomised clinical trials with at least one week of follow up evaluating varenicline as compared to a placebo in tobacco users reporting cardiovascular events. The conclusion of the study was that varenicline is associated with a "significantly increased risk of serious adverse cardiovascular events"—1.06% (52/4908) in the varenicline arm and 0.82% (27/3308) in the placebo arm. The study also said that the possible drug mechanisms associated with cardiovascular conditions include "action of the drug at the [alpha]-7 receptor in the brainstem or, similar to nicotine, a protombotic effect''.  The study can be accessed in full here (source: Pharmalot.com).  The pharma major has responded to the conclusions of the study by reaffirming the effectiveness of the drug and its benefit/risk profile. The firm has, however, questioned the reliability of the meta-analysis, noting the appropriateness of the risk measure used or composite endpoint which combines events that do not share a common biological cause. Furthermore, it has highlighted the small number of events studied as well as cast doubt over the manner in which the events were classified and counted. Significantly, the firm said it is discussing with the FDA a protocol to conduct its own meta-analysis to further evaluate the cardiovascular safety of the drug. Champix/Chantix is one of the firm's top drugs with a global approval reach of 99 countries, and prescribed to 13 million patients. The drug garnered sales of USD775 million in 2010.  The study's conclusions will affect the profile of Champix/Chantix, but to what extent will depend on the FDA's review of the meta-analyses conducted by Pfizer comparing it to the latest Johns Hopkins University study. Clearly, the results cast a negative light on the safety-profile of the drug, which is increasingly being used as a popular choice for smoking cessation in several countries where quit smoking campaigns have been initiated. The study raises two important questions which will be debated by the FDA in the short term. One, of course, is the safety profile of the drug and whether the latest study's methodology is representative of a small number of events or not. The drug already contains a "black box" warning following an FDA review in 2009 which highlights potential risks towards neuropsychiatry events such as suicidal thoughts, behavioural changes and depression among others in users. Hence, the addition of cardiovascular risk tied to the warning will affect the drug's prospects, but whether the benefit/risk profile is sufficiently tilted towards the negative will remain to be seen.  The other issue raised by the study is that of the FDA's accelerated approval procedure. It points out that the FDA had identified the cardiovascular adverse events linked to the drug at the time of review in 2006. But additional studies to establish a clear picture over the cardio effects was not followed up by the regulator. The FDA explained that at the time close inspection of the drug's cardio effects was followed up, but conflicting results had culminated in no changes to the label (source: Bloomberg). For Pfizer, the focus will be on taking into account the limitations of this latest study and creating a new one wherein the meta-analyses would potentially support the benefits of the drug outweighing risks.	bing

But it is, like any tobacco product, now banned from all of the buildings and grounds of Gloucester’s public schools.  The School Committee has voted to add electronic cigarettes to the list of items banned from all school properties and “school-sponsored events,” with potential fines for students and penalties for teachers, other staff members and school visitors. The ban is part of the committee’s and other city officials’ ongoing effort to promote health and fight substance abuse.  In its unanimous approval at a meeting last week, the committee — sitting for the first time except for is brief meeting at the city’s Jan. 1 inauguration ceremonies — added e-cigarettes to the existing policy that bans tobacco products in all schools and at all school events.  “It is the School Committee’s understanding that electronic cigarettes constitute a delivery system for nicotine, which is a fundamental ingredient in cigarettes and which is highly addictive,” committee members agreed in a prepared statement.  Citing the national Center for Disease Control, the committee noted that “nicotine can have a negative impact on brain development in teens. Electronic cigarettes are, therefore, prohibited in school and on school grounds, consistent with Gloucester Board of Health regulations.”  The move comes as cities, towns, and even state and federal agencies scramble to find effective means of regulating e-cigarettes, including the challenge of keeping them out of the hands of minors.  In general, an electronic or e-cigarette is a cigarette-shaped device containing a nicotine-based liquid that is vaporized and inhaled, simulating the experience of smoking tobacco.  A number of smokers and advocates view e-cigarettes as a healthier alternative to real cigarettes and other tobacco products, and as a means to wean users off tobacco products in an effort to quit the habit.  But the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is still seeking evidence as to whether they provide any true benefit, and many in the health-care community are dubious, given that — even in vapor form — they provide the user a hit of nicotine. Plus, the fact that the device does not include any tobacco means it falls outside the realm of traditional tobacco regulation, including sales to minors.  Mayor Carolyn Kirk, who sits on the School Committee and joined in the fully attended unanimous vote, along with new committee members Michelle Sweet and Jack O’Maley, said the board’s choice was not spurred by any signs of e-cigarette use in the schools, but more as a “proactive measure.”  “Partly, it’s because the School Committee is taking a top-to-bottom review of all its policies, and this is a policy that needed to be updated,” the mayor said.  “But we also wanted to be careful that we’re not sending any mixed messages to students,” Kirk said. “We want to be clear that have a zero-tolerance policy on issues such as this.”  With the update, the school board simply adds e-cigarettes to the policy covering the panel’s commitment to “having a tobacco-free environment for all members of the school community.”  “Use of any tobacco products within the school buildings, school facilities, on school grounds, at school sponsored events, or on school buses by any individual, including school personnel, and students, is prohibited at all times,” the policy reads.  The policy outlines specific penalties to be handed out to students, school personnel or visitors who violate it — with different penalties for students at different schools.  At Gloucester High School, students nabbed for a first offense are subject to a parent/legal guardian notification by letter and phone, three sessions of an after-school tobacco education program with proof of completion required, and a fine of $25.  Such students must pay the fine within 10 days, and failure to comply will result in “administrative disciplinary action,” with notification sent to the “appropriate extra-curricular review committee,” as well.  A second offense brings a parent/legal guardian notification and conference, with another documented three-session after-school tobacco education program and a fine of $50, with the same penalties for nonpayment and a requirement to complete 10 hours of supervised community service.  A third offense would bring similar penalties as a second violation, with the fine hiked up to $100 and the community-service requirement boosted to 20 hours.  Students found using tobacco products at O’Maley Innovation Middle School and all elementary schools will be subject to appropriate consequences for poor choices as listed in each school’s handbook — including, but not limited to, an after-school tobacco education program, a parent/legal guardian notification and conference, a “loss of privileges,” detention and possible school suspension.  Any violating school employees would also face “immediate disciplinary action in accordance with his/her contract,” while visitors would be issued a warning on first offense and asked to leave the school property in the case of a second violation.  In addition to the e-cigarettes, the policy covers “cigarettes, cigars, chewing tobacco, snuff, or any other form of tobacco,” while illegal uses include “smoking, inhaling, chewing, or otherwise causing a drug to reach the bloodstream or digestive tract on school property.”  Times Editor Ray Lamont can be reached at 978-675-2705, or via email at rlamlnt@gloucestertimes.com.	bing										
181	bd7c1ba2-71f4-3c86-af02-8478ab2baff9	Young adults say vaping helped them quit smoking, restrictions are dangerous	Buy Now Robert Cohen Surrounded by about 100 custom flavor juices and sample tanks, Mallory Immethun, 20, vapes while awaiting customers at Stella Blues Vapors in Fenton, Mo. Young adults say vaping helped them quit smoking, restrictions are dangerous MICHELE MUNZ St. Louis Post-Dispatch Updated Buy Now Robert Cohen Surrounded by about 100 custom flavor juices and sample tanks, Mallory Immethun, 20, vapes while awaiting customers at Stella Blues Vapors in Fenton, Mo. Evan Wright, 18, started smoking cigarettes and cigars early in high school. He sometimes smoked three cigars a night and began to have serious breathing problems, he said. A year ago, he started vaping, which delivers nicotine in an appealingly flavored aerosol without all the toxic chemicals that come from burning tobacco. His breathing problems went away. “Every day, I get the urge to go buy a cigar or a pack of cigarettes, but I pull out the vape and inhale the strawberry pina colada, and I’m good to go,” said Wright, of Des Peres, Mo. On the heels of an ordinance that passed last Tuesday banning the sale of both tobacco and vaping products to anyone under the age of 21 in St. Louis County, vaping business owners say they are worried less about their bottom line than about 18- to 21-year-olds no longer having the option to use vaping to quit smoking. “A lot of them are vaping because they quit cigarettes,” said Dru Fernandez, who owns Mape Vape in Maplewood, Mo. “I don’t know anybody who comes in here that starts vaping because they think it’s fun. Everybody that comes in here, they tell you a story that they used to smoke.” Fernandez said about 8 percent to 10 percent of his customers were ages 18-21. He’s not worried about the drop in customers when the law goes into effect Dec. 1, he said. “My main concern is the principle of this. A vapor product is not tobacco. You are taking away the option for younger adults to have safer alternatives than combustive tobacco.” LACK OF INFORMATION The two products are seen the same by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, however. The agency recently extended long-standing restrictions on cigarettes to vaping products, also known as e-cigarettes. Minors were banned from buying the products starting in August. The move was in response to the growing number of teens vaping. Between 2011 and 2015, e-cigarette use rose from 1.5 percent to 16 percent among high school students, and from 0.6 percent to 5.3 percent among middle school students, federal figures show. That means more than 3 million middle and high school students vaped in 2015. Whether e-cigarettes are safer than conventional cigarettes or help people quit smoking remains unclear because of the lack of information on the new devices, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. E-cigarettes are battery-operated devices that deliver nicotine and other flavorings in a vapor instead of smoke. Because they deliver nicotine without burning tobacco, they appear as a less toxic alternative to cigarettes. The deadly health consequences associated with smoking, such as cancer and heart disease, are linked to the inhalation of tar and other chemicals produced by tobacco combustion. The pleasurable, addictive properties are produced by nicotine. The dangers of nicotine alone are debatable. Some research suggests nicotine may prime the brain to become addicted to other substances, according to the drug abuse institute. A California study suggests teens experimenting with vaping were six times more likely than their peers to transition to tobacco. The vapor also has been found to contain carcinogens and toxic chemicals such as formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, as well as metal nanoparticles with unknown consequences from repeated exposure. St. Louis County is among 191 U.S. communities that have chosen to ban the sale of vaping products to anyone under the age 21, despite arguments by shop owners and former smokers that e-cigarettes serve as smoking cessation devices. St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay indicated on Twitter two weeks ago that he would pursue similar legislation for the city. Other physicians and health groups, such as the American Lung Association and the American Heart Association, also supported the county ordinance. St. Louis County Councilman Sam Page said the ordinance “will dramatically decrease smoking habits, and we will save kids’ lives.” ‘I FEEL A LOT HEALTHIER’ Despite the problems with e-cigarettes, however, major health organizations in England have found that vaping is about 95 percent less hazardous than smoking. And while federal figures show vaping among teens has increased since 2011, smoking tobacco has decreased: by 4.3 percent among middle school students and by 15.8 percent among high school students. Nearly nine out of 10 cigarette smokers first tried smoking by the age of 18, according the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Mallory Immethun, 20, of Fenton, Mo., said she started smoking cigarettes when she was 17. She smoked a pack a day, and her asthma worsened. When she started vaping nearly two years ago, she quit smoking immediately. “It just makes you feel so much better,” Immethun said. “I feel a lot healthier doing it.” Connor Schwieger, 18, of Maplewood, started smoking cigarettes when he was 14, also exacerbating his asthma. He began vaping about six months ago and kicked his tobacco habit. “I haven’t used my inhaler since,” Schwieger said. “I’ve been able to play volleyball for three hours. Before I could only play for one.” Tags	google										
182	25ebaf06-5fb7-3db0-8f0a-dfc8c394babf	Cigarette distributors face lawsuit	ALBANY – The state’s attorney general is stepping up efforts to combat the movement of tax-free cigarettes from Indian-owned companies in Canada to New York tribes, including the Seneca Nation of Indians.  Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman is expected to file a lawsuit Monday morning targeting a cigarette plant on the Six Nations of the Grand River Indian reservation near Hamilton, Ont., and a Seneca businessman working with the Canadian operation to sell billions of tax-free cigarettes marketed under the “Seneca” brand name, The Buffalo News has learned.  The state’s top lawyer wants the tax-free sales into New York halted, and tens of millions of dollars in penalties may be at stake. The lawsuit seeks to further reduce supplies of tax-free cigarettes by cutting off out-of-state supplies.  Schneiderman’s move against the cross-border cigarette operation comes a couple of months after he went to court seeking to stop a similar tax-free cigarette distribution operation by a company operating from a reservation in the state of Washington.  The Indian-owned companies that Schneiderman is expected to target Monday were the subject of an investigative report by The Buffalo News in 2009. That report found cigarettes made at the Ontario plant, including the Seneca brand cigarette, were sold through a complex distribution network of tax-free outlets.  Health officials raised concerns at the time that the Seneca brand was manufactured in violation of the state’s self-extinguishing law designed to reduce cigarette-caused fires and that Roswell Park Cancer Institute scientists worried about evidence of two metallic elements found in the cigarette’s tobacco.  The Seneca brand cigarettes, The News previously reported, were sold to tribes in New York, and also made their way out West through a trucking network that included stops on the Seneca reservations, at a Las Vegas warehouse and then to a California tribe.  Schneiderman, in a lawsuit to be filed in federal court in Brooklyn, is seeking to shut down the tax-free sales by Grand River Enterprises near Hamilton to the Native Wholesale Supply, owned by Arthur Montour. The Buffalo News phoned both companies seeking comment but there was no response.  The two companies acted in a “joint scheme” and during one recent eight-month period ending last July moved at least 687 million Seneca brand cigarettes onto the tax-free tobacco market, the suit will claim. The sales to Montour’s company totaled $85 million, which should have resulted in the state collecting $13 million in taxes, Schneiderman’s lawsuit will argue.  Montour runs Native Wholesale Supply from its Perrysburg base, but the company is legally incorporated through the Sac and Fox Nation in Oklahoma. Montour in 2011 filed for bankruptcy protection after a court said his firm was responsible for potentially tens of millions of dollars in federal tobacco assessments.  In New York, the Seneca brand is sold at small smoke shops on several Indian reservations in Western New York as well as the Oneida Indian Nation’s Turning Stone casino in Central New York.  Schneiderman’s new lawsuit comes after a relatively quiet period in the state’s cigarette tax battles with Indian tribes. The state in 2010 ended its forbearance policy towards tax-free cigarette sales by Indian retailers, despite laws that ban such trade. In June 2011, a court battle over that forbearance policy ended and New York began to enforce the law by requiring wholesalers to pay up-front excise taxes of $4.35 per pack.  But the Cuomo administration only applied the tax collection policy toward brand-name cigarettes and not the increasing number of cigarettes made by Native Americans on Indian reservations.  In December, Schneiderman sued King Mountain Tobacco, a firm on the Yakama Nation Tribe reservation in Washington. The legal claims of that case and much of the wording in the legal filing are the same as the lawsuit being filed Monday in Brooklyn against the Seneca businessman and the Ontario company.  The Indian cigarettes, sold for one-third or less the price of taxable cigarettes, cost the state money in lost taxes and take a health toll on smokers, especially teens who are also attracted to the cheaper prices.  The attorney general, in the court filing, will note that Ontario’s Grand River Enterprises knew its products were going to be sold in New York because it applied in July 2012 – three years after the Buffalo News article noting its products violated fire-safety laws – to the Department of State in Albany to say its products were now in compliance with the New York statute.  The Seneca brand distribution network violates various state and federal laws, the lawsuit contends. The suit says investigators from Schneiderman’s office in November seized Seneca cigarettes without tax stamps from a shop on the Poospatuk Reservation on Long Island. Another raid by federal agents occurred at the Skydancer smoke shop in Seneca Falls in January; that raid found 3 million unstamped Seneca brand cigarettes in the store.  The 2009 Buffalo News article noted that some industry executives estimated the Seneca brand sales could total 10 billion cigarettes a year.  Besides the two companies and Montour, the new Schneiderman lawsuit will be filed against Grand River’s principals – Jerry Montour, a member of the Wahta Mohawk tribe and no relation to Arthur Montour, and Kenneth Hill, a member of the Lower Mohawk tribe and a shareholder of the Ontario firm.	bing										
183	4a9ea6b5-a30f-3c1b-a30a-5868bd58a2f3	After UK exposé, local think tank says tobacco money no longer funding its research	In 2018, the Board agreed that Ideas would no longer accept research grants from the tobacco industry. — Picture by Farhan Najib KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 24 ― The Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs (Ideas) announced it no longer accepts money from the tobacco industry for its research, after its name and other think tanks worldwide were named in a British report today as donation recipients ― casting doubt on their studies to regulate smoking. The local think tank said the decision to stop carrying out research financed by tobacco players was made last year, even as it stressed its independence in its studies. “We have always been transparent about our funding, including from the tobacco industry and we have been uncompromising in our independence. “Our research priorities and policy positions reflect our principles of rule of law, free markets, limited government and individual liberty,” it said in a brief statement posted on its website today. “In 2018, the Board, in agreement with management, decided that Ideas would no longer accept research grants from the tobacco industry,” it added. The Guardian had highlighted Ideas had signed on to two separate letters in 2016 and 2018 to the World Health Organisation to oppose the idea of plain packaging for cigarettes, and had also in 2017 opposed the idea of increasing the prices of cigarettes in Malaysia by imposing higher taxes due to the concern that it would increase illegal activities. The Guardian said Ideas accepted funds from Philip Morris Singapore and Philip Morris Malaysia and that such funds from the Philip Morris International affiliates were during the 2015-2017 period, as well as funds from Japan Tobacco International in 2015 and 2017. The Guardian said British American Tobacco confirmed that it had given donations to Ideas, but the tobacco company did not state which years the donations were made. Among other things, Idaes had told The Guardian that it publishes its annual financial records on its website and that it may be the only civil society organisation in Malaysia which maintained this level of transparency. “In these financial records, the names of tobacco firms are clearly mentioned and we have never denied this,” the think-tank was quoted saying. Ideas also told The Guardian that it follows “a strict policy of editorial independence, which is a part of our contracts with all donors”, and that “no donations influence our research and analytical outputs” because of the policy. Ideas said it advocates against the sale of duty-free cigarettes in Malaysia, while also saying: “It is incorrect to say that we attribute smuggling to taxes alone.” In its response to The Guardian, Ideas was also quoted saying that there are multiple approaches to reduce public health harms, including controls. “Ideas has taken this view that government control measures alone cannot reduce tobacco usage and has encouraged to consider harm reduction approach,” it was quoted as saying, also noting that it believes “we need to align with the private sector to end smoking”.	bing

185	7f778e8b-31bb-318e-a682-9115480b397b	Tanzania: Action Sought to Rescue Tobacco Sector	Dodoma — The Parliamentary Industry, Trade and Environment Committee has tasked the Fair Competition Commission (FCC) to fully intervene and subsequently rescue the country's tobacco industry which is burdened by destructive pests, among other challenges. The Chairperson of the Committee, Mr Sadiq Murad, argued that the tobacco industry was in crisis, with both factories and growers in Morogoro and Tabora regions reportedly suffering from an extraordinary decline in production. Production of tobacco declined from at least 105 million kilograms in 2013 to 93 million kilograms in 2014. In 2015, production reached 72million kilograms but decreased to 60 million kilograms in 2016 and 50.5 million kilograms in 2017, according to government figures. "FCC must ensure that the tobacco crop survives rather than perishes," he said during a half-day workshop with the authority. FCC was briefing parliamentarians on the performance of the commission over the last four years of President John Magufuli's administration. According to the Chair, with the government pushing for an industrial economy, it remains imperative to promote fair competition in both sectors. The committee also expressed concern over unending trade disputes among Kariakoo business people. "There is absolutely no fair play at Kariakoo. We have further tasked the commission to uphold public awareness campaigns on counterfeit and substandard goods in the market," Murad told reporters shortly after the meeting with FCC management. Success! To complete the process, please follow the instructions in the email we just sent you. Error! Error! There was a problem processing your submission. Please try again later. FCC Director-General Dr John Mduma acknowledged challenges facing the tobacco industry, saying: "We have held discussions with the tobacco board in an attempt to understand the challenge." He said the commission will hold a meeting with the stakeholders in line with its duty. "Our duty is to promote and protect effective competition in trade and commerce and to protect consumers from unfair and misleading market conduct." He said during the Magufuli administration, the commission had successfully advanced its operations, forging collaboration with the Tanzania Bureau of Standards (TBS) to create public awareness as well as seizing counterfeit products that slow market competitions. Meanwhile, FCC Director of Research and Advocacy Dr Allan Mlulla seized the opportunity to call on the general public to take all precautions over counterfeit and substandard goods that come in the name of "cheap products." He said affordability can be extremely more costly not only to a consumer but the nation at large; that all players must join forces to ensure that the battle against counterfeit and substandard goods succeeds.

(KELO AM) - The Sioux Empire Tobacco Free Coalition estimates only a quarter of all Sioux Falls rental units are smoke-free.  Fran Rice says the Coalition held a workshop Tuesday for multi-unit owners, managers and tenants to help them establish smoke-free policies.  Rice says owners should realize substantial saving for operating a smoke-free apartment complex. She says general cleaning for non-smoking unit is usually around $240.  General cleaning for a heavy smoking unit can exceed $720.  Not to mention the health benefits to all tenants, both smokers and non-smokers.  Rice says the Coalition has been holding this type of workshop for six years.  She says since 2013, 2,440 living units have converted to tobacco free in Sioux Falls.  She says 900 units surrounding Sioux Falls have also made the switch.	google

189	2f51d7c2-e3d7-36fa-81bb-3a0af57ffe52	Will ENDS justify the means?	The global anti-tobacco conference’s move to allow member nations to prohibit or restrict sale of Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems provokes an outcry from harm reduction experts.  The global anti-tobacco conference winded down on Saturday toeing a hard line towards e-cigarettes and other vaping devices. The seventh session of the Conference of the Parties to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) ended with Southeast Asian countries voting for complete prohibition of Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) and Electronic Non-Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENNDS) in the region.  The World Health Organisation’s concern stems from the fact that while public health policy has been slow to catch up, ‘vaping’ — a ‘tobacco-free’ version of the cigarette where smokers inhale the vapour through liquid in a vaporiser — has become extremely popular among smokers as a ‘healthier’ option to smoking.  All vaping devices heat a solution called ‘e-liquid’ to create an aerosol; the e-liquid comes in flavours that are dissolved into propylene glycol or/and glycerine. Health organisations maintain that the toxicants generated by e-liquids can vary enormously — even within brands — due to the increased thermal decomposition of e-liquid ingredients with rising applied temperatures in open system devices.  Arguing that new nicotine replacement devices were not a valid substitute for people trying to stop smoking, the FCTC has voted in favour of a regulation that allows member nations to prohibit or restrict sale of ENDS/ENNDS devices. “It now depends on national laws but India is likely to opt for complete prohibition. Other countries might choose to restrict access. India has taken a unified stand against ENDS as there are enough tobacco products in the market already. It will take us years to understand the full effects of ENDS products. There is not enough research and a complete prohibition will help prevent more tobacco-related illnesses,” says a member of the Indian delegation. According to WHO, the global market for ENDS/ENNDS in 2015 was estimated at almost $10 billion.  International harm reduction experts, however, warn that measures to limit access to e-cigarettes will result in nearly a million smokers dying. A recently released documentary film about vaping, ‘A Billion Lives’, has argued that e-cigarettes, whose health risks are far lower, could be useful in saving lives.  Some experts claim the lack of transparent discussions on ENDS could cost lives. “These are closed-door meetings and WHO officials have drafted proposals to ban less harmful alternatives to cigarettes without consultation with many member countries. Instead of an open and transparent discussion exploring the evidence and science of better, safer, non-combustible nicotine delivery products, countries that do not agree with a ban are being excluded from the process and the FCTC is even withholding documents from delegations,” charges Julian Morris, vice-president of The Reason Foundation think tank and harm reduction expert.  Alleging that WHO is giving up its responsibility to save lives by recommending prohibition and restriction on ENDS/ENNDS, Riccardo Polosa, another harm reduction expert, says, “If this is true, it is simply outrageous. If the WHO extinguishes e-cigarettes (ENDS), it will have passed up what is clearly one of the biggest public health innovations of the past quarter century — one that could potentially prevent hundreds of millions of premature deaths. It will also have abrogated its responsibility under its own charter to empower consumers to take control of their own health, something that millions are already doing.”	google										
190	4203a993-552f-30db-989d-5e135131d997	Ban sale of cigarettes to under 21s to save young adults’ lives, MPs and doctors demand	Young adults under the age of 21 should be banned from buying cigarettes, MPs, doctors and campaigners say One leading doctor said the move would help curb peer pressure within schools and help stop the sale of cigarettes in the playground. The All Parliamentary Group on Smoking and Health has proposed raising the age of sale of tobacco to 21, "to discourage uptake by those most at risk". Smokers start as kids Dr Nicholas Hopkinson, a specialist at Imperial College London and the British Lung Foundation, backed the calls. He argued in the BMJ today that it would make it "harder for children to obtain cigarettes and would take the legal age beyond school age". Achieving a smoke-free generation - where smoking rates are below five per cent in all groups in society - is a "key public health goal". Dr Hopkinson, who is also chair of charity Action on Smoking and Health (Ash), said helping existing smokers quit is important. But he added: "The most vital element is to prevent young people from starting in the first place." Stop peer pressure Most smokers start as kids, and two thirds of those who try smoking will go on to become regular smokers. The habit is one of the leading causes of preventable deaths in Britain, drastically increasing a smoker's risk of various cancers and heart disease. Dr Hopkinson said increasing the legal age to buy cigarettes will help make it harder for kids buying and selling them at school. "Smoking is a contagious habit, transmitted within peer groups," he said. "The age increase will protect younger children from exposure to older pupils who smoke." Smoking rates fell when age raised from 16 to 18 When the UK increased the legal age from 16 to 18 in 2007, there was a fall in smoking rates among young people. Dr Hopkinson and other campaigners said this proposed further increase could help reduce rates even further. The age increase is part of a package of measures the APPG has suggested to Government. Bob Blackman, MP for Harrow West and chair of the APPG, said: "Smoking remains the leading cause of premature death and health inequalities. "Ratcheting up tobacco regulation further and faster is essential to achieve the Government's vision for prevention, to increase healthy life expectancy by five years by 2035 while reducing inequalities between the richest and poorest in society." The other measures put forward, include: A "polluter pays" tax - a charge on tobacco that could raise £150 million a year from cigarette companies to help pay for "revitalised, evidence-based ways to help smokers quit, and stop young people starting to smoke" retail licensing - a scheme to help limit underage sales, banning the sale of cigarettes from unlicensed shops spending on mass media education campaigns supporting regional tobacco control bodies that have a big impact Government-mandated flyers in cigarette packs to help encourage and support quitting banning ads that promote smoking in films and on TV Deborah Arnott, chief executive of Ash, told The Sun: "Ash supports increasing the age of sale from 18 to 21 as part of an integrated package of measures, not a pick and mix set of options. "The package includes a new 'polluter pays' charge on Big Tobacco to pay for anti-smoking measures, licensing of all tobacco retailers and stopping young people being exposed to smoking in film, on TV and social media."

191	bb519a23-b1a8-3213-b0b0-ff52753e94c9	Too many Americans still using tobacco, CDC says	Despite declining rates of cigarette smokers in recent years, too many Americans are still using tobacco, according to a new government report. The report, published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Center for Tobacco Products, found that 1 in 5 U.S. adults used some type of tobacco product in 2015. According to the CDC, cigarette smoking causes more than 480,000 deaths each year in the United States. That's equivalent to nearly one in five deaths. "Too many Americans are harmed by cigarette smoking, which is the nation's leading preventable cause of death and disease," CDC Director Brenda Fitzgerald, M.D., stated. "CDC will continue to use proven strategies to help smokers quit and to prevent children from using any tobacco products." The majority of tobacco users, about 42 million adults, reported using a combustible product, such as cigarettes, cigars, or pipes, including hookahs and water pipes. The remaining 7 million adult users opted for e-cigarettes or smokeless tobacco products such as chewing tobacco, snuff, dip, snus, and dissolvable tobacco. The data, which researchers gleaned from the 2015 National Health Interview Survey, also found that 9.5 million U.S. adults reported using two or more tobacco products. Cigarettes were by far the most popular tobacco product, used by 15.1 percent of American adults. E-cigarettes were the choice of 3.5 percent. The report also revealed differences in tobacco use based on people's sex, age, race/ethnicity, geographic region, education, income and other factors. For example, tobacco use was more common among men than women, and among adults ages 25 to 44 compared to those ages 65 and older. Tobacco use ranged from a low of 9 percent among Asian-Americans to a high of 26.6 percent among American Indians/Alaska Natives. Geographically, rates of tobacco use were higher in the Midwest and lower in the West. People with annual household incomes under $35,000 were also more likely to use tobacco, as were adults who didn't have health insurance or were insured through Medicaid. Finally, among all groups, using tobacco was most common in adults experiencing serious psychological distress (47.2 percent), compared to those who were not (19.2 percent). "These results make clear that more action is needed to reduce the disease and death caused by cigarette use, and the FDA has announced a comprehensive approach to do just that," said FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. Gottlieb said the FDA will focus on the role of nicotine in creating and sustaining cigarette addiction, and will seek to "regulate the nicotine content in cigarettes to render them minimally or non-addictive." He said the FDA will also work to encourage the development of "potentially less harmful products, including electronic nicotine delivery systems."	webhose.io

The traditional image of tobacco’s Marlboro Man is being replaced by the reality of a younger generation of tobacco users, hooked not on the old-school cigarettes of their parents’ generation but the e-cigarette, a battery-operated device that contains a solution of nicotine, flavorings and other chemicals that turns it into a mist that can be inhaled into the lungs. Also known as vaping, it has become the most popular form of tobacco use among teenagers in the U.S. and its popularity is on the rise. According to a Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report released in February, tobacco product use among youth is increasing. More than 1 in 4 high school students and approximately 1 in 14 middle school students in 2018 had used a tobacco product in the past 30 days, a considerable increase from 2017. This increase, CDC said, was driven by an increase in e-cigarette use, which went from 11.7% to 20.8 percent among high school students and 3.3 percent to 4.9 percent among middle school students. The brand Juul, whose e-cigarettes shaped like a USB flash drive make them easy to conceal from adults and whose pods come in flavors like mint, mango, crème, fruit and cucumber, have become especially popular among teens. The use of this product has been dubbed “Juuling.” Enticing flavors are not the only things the pods hold; each one contains at least as much nicotine as a pack of cigarettes. Nicotine is highly addictive and can harm adolescent brain development, which continues into the early to mid-20s. Local schools are not immune to the issue. One student at Randall Middle School, who prefers to remain anonymous, said students are brazenly “Juuling” right in the classroom. “Students will wait until teachers turn their back and then take a puff from their Juul and blow the smoke into their sweatshirt,” said the student, who has also seen them used in the bathrooms and hallways. The Media Outreach rep for the School District of Hillsborough County, who recognizes that there is e-cigarette use in schools, said the consequences for being caught vaping on school property would be the same as consequences for its cigarette policy. “It’s typically an administrative response,” she said. Consequences could include a student/parent/administrator conference, parent notification, reteaching of rules and expectations, in-school suspension or loss of privileges depending on the details of the incident. The big question is, how are students under the age of 18 getting their hands on these products? By law, people under the age of 18 should not be able to purchase tobacco products. Truth Initiative, an advocacy group committed to a culture where youth and young adults reject tobacco, surveyed more than 1,000 12 to 17-year-olds and found almost 74 percent purchased the product at a physical retail location. Older friends and family members in almost half of the instances purchased the product for them. Although Juul Labs had committed to refrain from selling the flavored pods in retail locations, local stores still have them on their shelves. The best defense against the increasing popularity of these products is for parents to be aware that the use of these odorless products is occurring. The U.S. Surgeon General encourages parents to talk to their children about the dangers of e-cigarettes. Be clear about your disapproval of them smoking or using e-cigarettes and encourage them to live tobacco-free.	rss										
193	cada976a-f0ef-374b-8c68-b16dae8bf639	Imperial Tobacco Canada Urges Parliament To Fairly Tax Vaping	With legal weed sales starting in Canada, MPs agree that the price should remain close to, or lower than, street prices. This has significant players wondering why this isn’t the case with nicotine products It’s widely agreed upon by members of parliament and public health officials in Canada that when weed becomes legal for sale later this year, the prices should not exceed what you can currently find on the street. The reasoning for this is obvious, wanting to limit possible reasons for consumers to continue to support untaxed, black market sales. With that being the case, many are now wondering why the same is not the case for another widely used drug, nicotine. In fact, even the head of Imperial Tobacco Canada agreed with this stance late last year. Bill Blair, who’s the MP in charge of the weed legalization, says that most provinces agree on the idea of pricing marijuana at lower costs than you could find on the street. He says this encourages more people to get their product from federally recognized and taxed vendors. Imperial Tobacco Canada’s Jorge Araya says that this logic should then also apply to the sale of nicotine products if the goal is to get more users to buy from licensed retailers instead of untaxed street operations. He openly acknowledged they are not seeking a drop in current taxed on combustible cigarettes though, but rather seeking reasonable regulation on e-cigarettes and heat-not-burn products. Imperial Tobacco Canada’s Stance In Imperial Tobacco’s eyes, along with much of the rest of Big Tobacco companies, vaping and heat-not-burn products represent the future of their industry. These devices, which Jorge Araya called, “less-risky” during his press conference, have often been misleadingly equated with much more dangerous combustible cigarettes. He went on to lament the taxes placed on traditional cigarettes, but was sure to be clear that their aim is not to lower these taxes, which he says “pay for the externalities and health impacts that we create.” Instead, he wants to keep these taxes where they are while keeping taxes on vaping products at a competitive level, to discourage black market sales. According to Araya, around 70% of the cost of a pack of cigarettes in Canada is just from taxes. This high rate of taxing has an estimated 25% of cigarette sales in Canada happening outside of the taxable economy, accounting for billions of lost dollars every year. He fears that if the same level of taxes is placed on e-cigarettes, then an even higher number of users will turn to the unregulated market for their supplies. Currently, Bill S-5, which would officially legalize nicotine e-liquids in the country is being debated in the Senate. Imperial Tobacco is on board with this move and is hoping to influence the direction of deliberations. Best Path Forward Regardless of the outcome of Bill S-5, the administration tasked with authorizing the sale of vaping products is Health Canada. That is of course unless they choose to not advertise as a safer alternative to smoking with medicinal purposes. But since vaping is often seen as and used as a smoking cessation device, this would likely allow Health Canada to continue to be the gatekeeper for vaping across the country. Understanding this, companies like Imperial Tobacco are hoping to sit down with the government to decide together the best path forward. What they hope to accomplish is regulations that are profitable for the state, but also sustainable for the industry as well. Not everyone is on board with this proposal though, as some anti-tobacco groups have blasted the comparison of weed and nicotine vaping. They reason that since pot has never been shown to kill people, it’s much more worthy of being fairly taxed than something that has killed millions of people like tobacco. The trouble is that nicotine is not what kills you. Most doctors agree that nicotine alone is relatively innocuous, most similar in effect to caffeine. Instead, it’s the countless other substances found in cigarette smoke doing almost all of the long-term damage. It’s precisely these substances that vaping was created to eliminate without having to give up the nicotine or psychological cues that go along with smoking. Implications The argument of anti-tobacco lobbyists in Canada is emblematic of one of the most significant problems facing vaping as a whole. That is the total misunderstanding and subsequent misrepresentation of the dangers and uses of vaping products. The idea that vaping should be harshly regulated merely because tobacco has directly lead to countless deaths is misguided and detrimental to the same people they’re claiming to help. Vaping is not smoking, and their risks are not synonymous. If taxes on weed are to be kept low to help foster their legal sale, then the same should be true for vaping, which has also never been shown to lead to any death. The anti-tobacco groups who seek to equate vaping with smoking are actually giving a distinct advantage to Big Tobacco by helping the general public see the two products as virtually the same. But if you genuinely care about saving lives from smoking, then vaping should be supported as one of the best tools we have at our disposal. Do you think it’s wrong for vaping to be taxed like combustible cigarettes? Do you think that increased taxes create an advantage for black market vendors? How can we reconcile the need for regulation with the fact that vaping and smoking are not one in the same? Let us know what you think in the comments.

NYC mayor wants highest cigarette prices in US	FILE - In this April 7, 2017, file photo, cigarette butts are discarded in an ashtray outside a New York office building. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced a plan on April 19, 2017, to raise the price of a pack of cigarettes from $10.50 to $13 in the city. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File)  NEW YORK (AP) — The minimum price for a pack of cigarettes would rise to $13 in New York City under a proposal backed by Mayor Bill de Blasio.  De Blasio is backing an effort to force people to quit smoking by raising the city's current legal minimum price of a pack from $10.50, further cementing New York City's claim on having among the most expensive cigarettes in the country.  The Democrat announced his support Wednesday for a series of legislative proposals that he said could reduce the number of smokers in the city by 160,000 by the year 2020. An estimated 900,000 New York City residents currently smoke.  "What we're here today talking about is saving lives," said Dr. Mary T. Bassett, the city's health commissioner, who appeared with the mayor at offices of the American Heart Association. "We want to make it easier to quit and harder to smoke."  The proposals are set for hearings later this month.  The city council also will consider legislation to gradually reduce by half the number of licenses issued to retailers to sell tobacco products. Philadelphia and San Francisco have similar licensing restrictions.  An American Cancer Society study found that 8,992 retail outlets were licensed to sell tobacco in New York as of October, and about a third of those were within 500 feet of a school.  Other proposals would set minimum prices and create taxes on smokeless tobacco and small cigars, and require sellers of electronic cigarettes to obtain licenses.  Opponents of the city's high cigarette prices have argued that it has pushed many smokers into buying untaxed, unregulated cigarettes on the black market.	webhose.io

By 3pm, the pop-up shop will vanish and the fans will disappear. This experience on the New York streets on this balmy summer Sunday is indicative of both the widening delta between generational mindsets, and the new and unexpected ways in which 10 to 20-somethings are consuming media. What is going on here? Why are people so obsessed with a YouTuber? Perhaps this generation’s attraction to Logan Paul’s free-spirited character reflects a broader shift — a transformation in how digital natives relate to their favorite brands. To understand what’s going on, let’s start by looking at how media shapes brand communications. Then we’ll dive into a history of brands and their evolution. Marshall McLuhan is universally regarded as the father of communications and media studies. Illustrating the power of media shifts, he writes: “Societies have been shaped more by the nature of the media by which men communicate than by the content of the communication… All media works us over completely… and leaves no part of us untouched, unaffected, and unaltered. The medium is the message.” McLuhan observed how communications technologies determine the structure of society. The printing press took society from an oral culture to one of print and literacy. Movable type allowed humans to accurately reproduce texts at great speed. This created a more visual world. The printing press — and the shift in media consumption that it catalyzed — was responsible in no small part for social shifts such as the emergence of nationalism, the homogenization of society, and the standardization of culture. As McLuhan observed, we do not merely use technology — it reinvents us. Companies who own and manage brands must adapt when humans develop new ways of communicating. The history and evolution of branding can be summarized in four distinct economic periods: agricultural, early-industrial, late-industrial, and digital. 1. Brands in the Agricultural Economy During the agricultural economy, communities were organized around farming and gaming livestock. During this time, “brands” defined unique ownership. The word brand derives from brandr, meaning “to burn.” Around 950 A.D., “a brand” referred to a burnt piece of wood. Around the same time, Roman glassmakers branded their works using glass molds and marks. Other artisans in the 13th century used brands in the form of watermarks on paper, stamps, hallmarks, and silver-makers’ marks on paper. Livestock branding can be traced back to the ancient Egyptians, some of whom believed that brands were a magic spell that could protect animals from harm, and by the 1500s, individual ranches branded their livestock. Unbranded cattle, known as mavericks, often escaped across fences, only to be rounded up by neighboring ranchers. To claim ownership, ranchers created unique, permanent marks on their livestock — brands — to determine if their animals were lost, stolen, or mixed in with similar animals from another range. Livestock brands demonstrated defined property rights and signified value. Like successful modern brands, brands in the agricultural economy were symbolic, permanent and easy to identify. 2. Brands in the Early-Industrial Era Industrialization moved the production of many household items from local communities to centralized factories. Mechanization, rapidly declining transportation costs, and global trade allowed products to be manufactured, distributed and consumed in mass quantities in regions across the world. Some companies became global; they branded their logos on shipping barrels that traveled internationally. This global trend started with alcohol. Fermented liquor producers who produced beer, ale, and wine distinguished their products by burning their logos on crates and cases of goods. Food aggregators, who stored grains and cured dried fish and specialty meats, adopted a similar strategy. Brands differentiated the type, source, and quality of products, becoming symbols of quality and trust. This added value, reliability and consistency, which boosted consumer loyalty. This, along with fleets of marine vessels, enabled global trade, and in turn, increased sales volume. Brands that were perceived as trustworthy commanded bigger margins than undistinguished alternatives. Products without recognizable brands risked commoditization, and as the industrial revolution matured, branding became a standard practice. As branding caught on, the need for its regulation became abundantly clear, and the American government created new laws to govern the process. Beginning in 1870, American companies could register trademarks. Competitors were prohibited from creating visually similar, “copycat” brand names and labels. Competitors could mimic product features, but nobody could legally replicate brands. By the early 20th century, beverage companies such as Base Ale, Stella Artois and Coca-Cola had widely recognized brands. Beginning after World War II, mass media propelled their growth. Consumers began to develop social and psychological relationships with brands, a trend that accelerated through the late-industrial era. Mass media birthed national and even multinational brands. Popular culture stretched beyond print and radio — to television, which infiltrated consumers’ domestic and social lives. By the mid 1950’s, television had cemented its position as the single most important form of entertainment. TV commanded the lion’s share of advertising revenue. – – – As Tim Wu observed in his book, Attention Merchants, the mid-1950s was a historic anomaly. Never had so many people paid attention to the same set of messages at the same time. 82.6% of American television viewers tuned into Elvis Presley’s first television appearance on CBS’s ED Sullivan Show. “Prime Time,” an invention of TV business moguls, made watching television a societal ritual. Some TV programs lost money on the content itself, but profited substantially from selling TV advertising by airing regular commercial breaks between regular programming. Brands achieved national — even global — recognition. It was the brand — not the product — which informed more and more consumer purchasing decisions. The big got bigger. On popular prime time television, only the highest commercial bidders (America’s largest corporations) could afford to advertise, and thus, advertising became a booming and lucrative industry. Madison Avenue lit up. Detroit flourished. The fashion, cosmetics, personal care and, tobacco industries boomed. Industrial product manufacturing took off. With direct access to engaged public minds, advertisers manipulated human motivations and desires, thereby creating demand for their “must have” products. Marketers used mainstream and efficient distribution to globalize American culture. America, defined by its material abundance, became an aspirational tentpole for the world to lust over. Various cultures throughout the world have been interconnected through trade, wars, migration, and slavery. Television effectively intensified this cross-cultural pollination. Multinational brands dominated. Advertising agencies were born. Mad Men were living large. Through the synthesis of packaging, labels, visual icons, colors, typography and sound, brands etched themselves into public minds. Some used iconic characters and catchy jingles to garner attention. Some brands focused on the continental United States: Dunkin’ Donuts, Burger King, Wendy’s. Others went global: McDonald’s, Burger King, Mercedes, Michelin, Starbucks. Regardless, their growth tactics mirrored each other, as both national and global brands used media to influence culture and infiltrate the changing fabric of society. Brands became a center point of ordinary social conversation. Through memorable television media experiences with high production value and premium sponsorships, brands shaped our aspirations. They defined “The American Dream.” Apple promoted human freedom in a famous 1984 advertisement that introduced the Macintosh. Its brand and logo earned national prestige — particularly among creative types. Nike’s brilliance came from sponsoring the world’s greatest athletes: Tiger Woods, Michael Jordan, and Roger Federer, all of whom donned the Nike swoosh. Brands moved beyond visual names and spoken words. For the first time, advertising and culture were inextricably linked. In each period we’ve discussed: agricultural, early-industrial, and late-industrial, we find similar shifts in the way media is produced, distributed, and consumed. Today, popular influencers are capitalizing on this shift. Inspired by transparancy, they have built loyal followings, and now, they are building companies. Successful influencers are perceived as genuine, sincere, and most of all, transparent. They differ widely from institutions built during the industrial era. Brands built during the late-industrial era garnered trust through mass marketing, as opposed to transparency. This is no longer a sustainable strategy. Today, brands are responding to the effects of social media and the smartphone on media consumption. The ROI on transparency is increasing. Nowhere is this more apparent than in shopping and lifestyle brands, like that which drove a mile-long line for nothing but a short lived pop-up shop in New York City. Digital communication has caused demand for transparency and authenticity to explode. The most dominant company in America illustrates how. Amazon (“The Everything Store”) is a central location for almost every product one can buy. It’s the most trusted retailer in the world. Amazon customers are increasingly persuaded by transparency and customer reviews, and less by brand value gained through traditional advertising. Catchy slogans, jingles, premium aesthetics and expensive packaging have almost zero weight, especially in a market where consumers can place orders for goods with nothing more than their voice. It follows that Amazon purchasing decisions are less influenced by manufactured brands, and more by key words, product ingredients, and specific customer uses cases. This shift is apparent on other large algorithmically sorted platforms such as Facebook and Google. By answering the age-old question of who to trust, reviews and transparency carry have significantly diminished the value of traditional brands. In response, a new reality is taking shape. – – – Large platforms have fueled the colorful influencer phenomenon. Today’s up-and-coming brands — especially brands geared towards digital natives — are driven by social media influencers. Brands, which once commanded attention through colorful logos, broadcast advertisements and catchy jingles, are now popularized by the influencers who represent them. These emerging brands attract obsessive “superfans.” Their fandom is not consumptive, but rather performative, active, and social. Subcultures of intense fandom are centered on a set of activities— pilgrimages, rituals, socializing, and evangelizing. This almost religious phenomenon has existed since the classical music days of Mozart and Liszt, but since social media provides intimate, immediate access to stars, and since those stars are famous not because their anxieties, struggles, and triumphs are unimaginable, but rather because in many ways, they feel as if they could be our own, influencers’ relationships with their fans have a deepness to them that is almost unimaginable for celebrities and fans of a bygone era. Social media-driven culture is underestimated because of the lack of common knowledge about it. (A fact is “common knowledge” if everybody knows it; and, everybody knows that everybody knows it; and so on ad infinitum.) We proudly represent Nike and Apple in public, but relationships with influencers are largely restricted to the private domain. As a result, influencers and the brands they are building are under-appreciated and widely misunderstood. – – – Examples: Casey Neistat and Emily Weiss Technology changes but human nature doesn’t. Throughout history, people have congregated around strong, singular personalities much like moths to light. Today, social media makes it easy to discover, align with, and follow such personalities. Emily Weiss is on a mission to build a beauty brand for the Instagram generation. Her beauty brand, Glossier, has inspired cult-like loyalty through transparency. She actively maintains her popular Into the Gloss beauty blog, which she started as a side project in 2010 while working as a Vogue fashion assistant. She built a community of fans before hinting at her first Glossier product. Her other posts are more casual. On Instagram, she feels more like a friend, sharing photos from sun-soaked days at the beach, (seemingly) unedited selfies from her living room, and updates on company anniversary parties. Photos from her private vacation trips to the beach are akin to what any close friend would typically post. Emily Weiss’ posts document the glamorous side of her entrepreneurship — boujee restaurants, prestigious conferences, and sun-soaked beaches, attracting fervid social media followers. With a tribe of dedicated commenters and fans, Glossier crowdsources new product ideas. Emily Weiss, Instagram Similarly, Casey Neistat started his daily vlog to highlight the day-to-day operations of starting and growing his company, Beme. Among other things, Neistat used the vlog to document feature launches and discuss his company’s struggles. The app struggled, but the vlog thrived. As I write this, Neistat has more than 7 million YouTube subscribers. Consider this: some of Casey Neistat’s fans tuned into each of his 500 vlogs, many of which were more than ten minutes long. Those who did, have likely spent more intimate time with Neistat than most of their best friends and family during this time. This is especially true for fans with leisure time, many of whom are young adults, and are no longer in school. Casey Neistat uses his YouTube channel to rally support around business initiatives, such as his forthcoming news show. Because of his consistent transparency, his fans feel invested in his endeavors. They assume the role of a trusted confidant. If the show becomes popular, fans like myself will take pride in saying they saw the first, unpolished, test episode of Beme News. By broadcasting Beme’s humble beginnings, Casey Neistat invites us to support the company’s growth — physically, emotionally, and financially. In this modern age, fans don’t just want to support favorite brands. They want to establish emotional connections with them. They want to shape their evolution and feel intimately close to the people who inspire them. This fandom is no different from the pride one gets from discovering an up-and-coming rapper after their first mixtape or watching an NBA star dominate in high school. Emily Weiss and Casey Neistat are pioneering modern, digitally native brand standards. As a result, they’ve built globally recognized personal brands and have attained celebrity status, reaching hundreds of millions of fans in less than a decade. Because of social media, young audiences are attached to influencers with eccentric — and often polarizing — personalities. – – – Naked Brands In the words of Marshall McLuhan: “we drive towards the future using only our rear-view mirror.” Today we’re moving towards an immersive and interconnected world, our lives awash with digital technology. History predicts an impending shift. The Internet will spawn new brand archetypes, powered by social media influencers who are mere clicks away at all times. Social media mavens Logan Paul, Casey Neistat and Emily Weiss hint at a changing of the guard — the rise of Naked Brands.™ Naked Brands are transparent. They are founded by social media influencers, and prize ongoing communication with fans. Their brands are defined not by symbols, logos, or television advertisements, but by the authenticity of their personalities.

Veterans of Foreign Wars Rocket Post 4534 is the latest in a growing number of VFW posts and other gathering places for veterans to make the decision to ban smoking inside its buildings.  Some regulars have not been seen in the canteen since the decision a few days ago, but commanders hope a sign out front that touts the "No smoking Post" could attract some new members.  "I'm an ex-smoker, so I feel their pain," post commander Ron Greco said. Now smokers gather at tables under a large tent outside next to the post.  Though most indoor smoking is banned in public places in Florida and other states, the posts, which are not normally open to the public, are an exception.  While the posts set their own smoking policies, the VFW's national offices have encouraged the locals to consider going smoke free to help attract non-smokers and young veterans.  "To attract the new generation you have to meet their needs," said Joe Davis, a national VFW spokesman. "One way is having non-smoking posts."  Each post can vote on whether they want to go smoke-free, he said. The VFW and the American Legion could not give an estimate of how many posts are smokeless.  Earlier generations of service members were all but encouraged to smoke. During World War II and the Korean and Vietnam wars, soldiers received cigarettes along with their field rations.  That changed in 1986 when the Pentagon banned the use of tobacco during basic training and increased the number of designated nonsmoking areas.  Some veterans are adamant about their right to smoke.  "I did five tours in 'Nam, now I got to come to this crap," said Navy veteran Bob Cinelli of Melbourne as he smoked under the tent outside the post.  But sitting at the bar inside the post, Paul Knapp said he is glad the building is now nonsmoking.  "I think we're beginning to see that everybody should give up the cigarettes," he said.

199	dd9a6523-bb47-3bca-b3b8-2ded0591c225	Illinois Ashes Tobacco Age Bill	Illinois Public Media Illinois Ashes Tobacco Age Bill The age to buy cigarettes and other tobacco products in Illinois remains at 18, for now. The Illinois House of Representatives failed to override Republican Governor Bruce Rauner’s veto on Wednesday with a vote of 62-45. The measure passed the House in the spring with 61 votes. Bill sponsor Camille Lilly (D-Chicago) said she knew getting 71 votes – the necessary number to override– was highly unlikely. Still, she called the bill to “keep the conversation going" and said she will be back next session with a similar push. “Presenting it in the next General Assembly under a new governor who believes in this project and believes this is something we should be doing,” Lilly said. However, Governor-elect JB Pritzker has yet to take a stance on the issue. In a statement, his spokesperson said: "We'll have to see if the new General Assembly has the votes to pass it again next year and then (Pritzker) will work with stakeholders to figure out what's best for Illinois." Along with increasing the age, the measure also would remove any penalties for minors who do get their hands on tobacco products. Opponents took issue with this provision. State Rep. Peter Breen (R-Lombard) was one of them. “So what you’re doing is creating an incentive for folks under 21," said Breen. "They can now possess tobacco under your bill. Whereas today, they would not be able to.” Despite the objections to this portion of the proposal, Lilly said it will still be included in the bill filed next year. She said this is because she believes minors should not be the ones being punished and tobacco companies should be held accountable. The Senate narrowly voted to override the veto earlier this month. Dozens of Illinois communities have already adopted their own laws raising the age from 18 to 21.	google										
200	f6e459c8-218a-3cf1-8939-2de1384fcac1	Trade agreement should help fight tobacco	Now that Congress has provided President Obama with the authority to negotiate the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, he and U.S. trade representative Ambassador Michael Froman have the unique opportunity to help curb the tobacco epidemic.  The president and ambassador should insist that tobacco be granted a full carve out from the TPP, and from all other trade agreements. A carve out means tobacco products will be excluded from the rights and benefits of the trade agreement, providing governments with protection to regulate tobacco inside their borders without fear of being sued by the tobacco industry.  The tobacco industry has long used litigation, and trade agreements in particular, as a tool to block public health and tobacco control laws. For example, they created a chilling legal climate by threatening to sue Togo, one of the 10 poorest countries on earth, if Togo implemented graphic health warning labels on cigarette packs. Additionally, Australia and Uruguay are currently being sued over their tobacco packaging laws.  The TPP represents a crucial moment for tobacco control. Once completed, it will be the largest regional trading block in the world and will serve as the model for 21st-century trade agreements. How tobacco is treated in the TPP will set the precedent for how tobacco will be treated in the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Agreement, an even larger agreement, and in future trade agreements worldwide.  I urge the president to carve out tobacco from all of our trade agreements to save millions of people from tobacco-related diseases and death.
