Qatar attends meet on illicit trade of tobacco products 
.W 
THE State of Qatar is participating in the first meeting of the Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products with a delegation from the Ministry of Public Health and Hamad Medical Corporation's Tobacco Control Center. The Qatar delegation had participated also in the eighth session of the WHO Framework Convention for Tobacco Control (FCTC), which concluded in Geneva on Saturday. Communications officer on the FCTC Dr Kholoud al Mutawa, who is also Head of the Non-Communicable Diseases department in the Ministry of Public Health, reviewed the positive developments and achievements of the countries of the Eastern Mediterranean region in the area of tobacco control and the challenges faced by some states in controlling this practice. She noted that five countries in the region have joined the Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products during the current year, expressing the hope that more states will join the protocol in the coming period. She highlighted that the region's countries are facing a major challenge in keeping tobacco control a top priority in the face of the other challenges they have to deal with, especially as a large group of countries are facing emergencies or are recovering from a previous emergency. She maintained, however, that the ministries of health are pushing the tobacco control agenda forward. (QNA)

Beaches into ashtrays': After conditional veto, smoking still OK on most NJ beaches 
.W 
On an Atlantic City beach, a group of five adults recently sat a few feet from the ocean, some with lit cigars in hand.  They placed makeshift ashtrays, really just upside-down seashells, next to their beach chairs, storing discarded cigars there. Two from the group - Monica Plumley, 48, of Glassboro, and Shelley Gatanis, 50, of Woodstown - had just met each other that day, and bonded over cigars.  "I want to be able to do anything that's appropriate freely," Plumley said of their right to smoke on the sand. "I keep it all in my little area. . . . I put it in a neat little pile, pick it up and take it up for trash."  "If they're going to smoke, they're going to smoke," added Gatanis' father, Doug Hopkins, 72, visiting from Appling, Ga. He, like Plumley, had a cigar in hand and puffs of smoke coming from his mouth.  There is no smoking ban on Atlantic City beaches, and much to smokers' relief, there won't be at any time soon.  After New Jersey lawmakers approved a bill that would ban smoking in all public parks and beaches in the state, Gov. Christie last month issued a conditional veto and instead offered to support a smoking ban solely on state-owned parks and beaches. The legislature must act on that proposal.  The bill vetoed by Christie would have expanded the New Jersey Smoke Free Air Act, which banned smoking in all indoor public spaces, to include every public park and beach. This essentially would make the state's entire 130-mile coastline - beaches from Sandy Hook to Cape May - smoke-free. The bill would also allow for beaches to establish designated smoking areas.  "I abhor smoking," Christie wrote in the veto. "But I continue to believe that the state should not impose its will upon our local governments, and instead continue to leave it up to towns and counties whether to ban smoking in their parks and beaches."  In 2014, Christie vetoed a similar bill that aimed to ban smoking on all public parks and beaches. This time, he offered changes to the bill instead of shutting it down completely, and mentioned that several local governments have imposed their own smoking bans.  Several New Jersey beaches have taken that matter into their own hands, as the veto language suggests. According to the America Nonsmoker's Rights Foundation, 15 beaches in New Jersey have implemented smoke-free beach laws.  Some beaches along Long Beach Island, for example, have implemented a smoking ban, including Long Beach Township and now Beach Haven, whose smoking ban went into effect on June 8.  "The mayor and council felt a responsibility to protect young children from secondhand smoke," said Beach Haven Municipal Clerk Sherry Mason. "They didn't want to wait."  Mason said the town had been discussing the ban and were waiting to see what the state would do, but the township came to the decision in April to prepare for the current beach season. This came two years after nearby Long Beach Township also implemented a ban on smoking along the beach.  Mason said beach rakes had been picking up a lot of cigarette butts, and this measure would help with that as beach seasons continue.  Denise Glass, 35, of Bordentown, said she frequently comes to LBI with her 3-year-old son. She's against smoking on the beach, and would take banned areas into consideration when choosing a place to go.  "It's just bad for you," she said. "I'm in support of a ban."  But not all jurisdictions along Long Beach Island have banned smoking. Surf City Mayor Francis Hodgson said after watching the governor's decision, the township does not intend to ban smoking on the beach.  "We discussed it, and the council and myself feel as though this is a family resort and a summer resort," he said. "People come away to relax and enjoy themselves - if a guy wants to sit on the beach and smoke a cigar, let him go."  While Hodgson said he doesn't smoke and does not enjoy the smell of it, the township doesn't want to "deprive somebody else of their enjoyment."  He said there have not been many problems with complaints about smokers on the beach, but he did say there have been some people who inquire about it. As of now, he said, he thinks it would be a challenge to enforce a ban.  Further down the shore, Ocean City has had a smoking ban along its boardwalk since 2014. While there is no ban on the beach, Doug Bergen, the city's public information officer, said he could see the administration discussing a law for the future, perhaps for the next summer season.  Lisa Ambrosino, 47, of Mount Laurel, came to visit Ocean City and lit up a cigarette while on the beach. She said she always cleans up her cigarette butts and makes an effort to avoid causing problems for others around her.  "It's my decision," she said, with a cigarette in hand. "We're outside. I understand secondhand smoke, but we're outside."  New Jersey Sierra Club director Jeff Tittel said he believes Christie is "sacrificing" the health and safety of people on the beach with the veto, considering secondhand smoke and potentially lit cigarettes buried in the sand.  "This is a health issue, and it's an important one. What our governor did was just wrong," he said. "We shouldn't be OK with turning our beaches into ashtrays."  Cora Rosenhaft, 41, of Damascus, Md., often visits Ocean City and was on vacation recently. She said she doesn't enjoy it when others smoke on the beach but understands that people want to.  "I prefer it when it isn't around," she said. "But it hasn't been a big problem while we're here."  Back in Atlantic City, cigarette butts were scattered throughout the Boardwalk and cigarette discard stations sat above the beach line on the boards.  Plumley, smoking a cigar while standing on the sand, said she wouldn't support a smoking ban on beaches and thinks the responsibility lies on those who are smoking to clean up and not bother nonsmokers. She said she "can't stand" people who don't clean up after themselves.  Assemblywoman Valerie Vainieri Huttle (D., Bergen), a primary sponsor of the bill, said she thinks it's not enough, though. When a new governor takes office, Huttle said, they will try to pass the bill again.  "I was hoping that the outcome would be different this session," Huttle said. "A uniform policy makes much more sense and, quite frankly, it protects the residents more equally."  Still, Huttle said she expects the amended bill to pass.  "It's better than nothing," she said. "I don't think we'll let this one go."

President Obama Signs Bill Requiring Child Resistant E-Liquid Packaging 
.W 
President Barack Obama signed S. 142, the “Child Nicotine Poisoning Prevention Act of 2015,” which was introduced a year ago by Senator Bill Nelson (D-Florida), Senator Kelly Ayotte (R-New Hampshire), and 20 other U.S. senators.  It requires the packaging of liquid nicotine containers to be subject to existing child poisoning prevention packaging standards. Child-resistant caps on e-liquid products were already the law in 15 states, and child-resistant packaging is also a requirement for members of the American E-Liquid Manufacturing Standards Association.  One teaspoon of liquid nicotine is potentially lethal to a child, according to the American Association of Poison Control Centers. In 2014, poison control centers reported 3,783 e-cigarette and liquid nicotine exposure cases, over half involving children under age 6. In December 2014, a 1-year-old boy in New York died after ingesting liquid nicotine.  Under the law, which the President signed last week, liquid nicotine can only be sold in child-resistant bottles and containers that meet the same standards as other potentially poisonous household substances, as set forth in the Poison Prevention Packaging Act of 1970.  The American Vaping Association and tobacco harm reduction and smoking cessation groups all agree that child-resistant packaging is needed and regulation was needed to prevent “bad actors” in the marketplace from putting kids at risk.  The law excludes sealed, pre-filled, and disposable containers that are inserted directly into an electronic cigarette.

As crisis looms, Oregon officials propose vaping ban 
.W 
State health officials want Oregon stop the sale of vaping products as investigations in continue into mounting cases of illnesses and deaths. Those who vape have been asked by authorities, including Gov. Kate Brown, to voluntarily stop vaping. By Sam Stites - Oregon Capital BureauSeptember 28, 2019 at 5:08am Oregon State Capitol, governor's office (Salem Reporter/file) SALEM -- The Oregon Health Authority is recommending that Gov. Kate Brown ban for six months the display and sale of all vaping products, both nicotine and cannabis based. The recommendation is one of six related to curtailing use of vaping products across the state and comes after state officials, including the governor, urged consumers to voluntarily stop using vaping products. Brown has asked the state Justice Department to review the options before she takes executive action. The governor sought the health agency’s recommendations following the announcement Thursday of the second Oregon death related to vaping. State officials gave no indication when a ban might take effect, but Health Authority officials said such a ban should remain in place while federal agencies investigate vape-related illnesses. “The safety of this product has been in question for a long time,” Dr. Dean Sidelinger, state health officer, told reporters during a Sept. 26 press conference. “We know this product is not safe and have seen health effects from it with acute respiratory injuries and death. We do urge all individuals to stop vaping whether that’s nicotine-based products, cannabis products or other. People who haven’t vaped, shouldn’t start.” The Health Authority’s recommendations included improving access to federally -approved methods to quit smoking. The agency also proposes providing eight weeks of free nicotine-replacement therapy “without barriers,” according to an agency statement. The Health Authority also suggests that the state urge the FDA to regulate vaping products and establish a ban on internet sales of tobacco and online marketing of vaping products. The agency also wants health care providers to continue reporting cases of acute respiratory injury related to vaping so the state can compile data and establish a better understanding its health effects. Finally, the Health Authority recommended Brown create a workgroup of health professionals and government leaders to develop additional recommendations to address what the state now considers a crisis. “Our office will be working closely with DOJ, the OHA, and other relevant state agencies to determine a path forward under Oregon law that protects the public health of all Oregonians when it comes to vaping products,” the governor said in a statement. State health officials have so far identified five cases of acute respiratory illness related to vaping both nicotine-based products and cannabis products. The state’s first death related to vaping was announced Sept. 3. According to Sidelinger, the five patients who were hospitalized reported shortness of breath and trouble breathing, which progressed. More than 800 cases of vaping-related illness have been reported across the nation. There have been a dozen deaths reported in several states. “The latest individual who died, like the other case, was an adult, and did report using cannabis products,” said Sidelinger, who couldn’t provide more detailed information about the victim. Sidelinger said that the five people being treated had used licensed cannabis products. The Health Authority expects more cases to be reported. Dr. Jennifer Vines, Multnomah County deputy health officer, said her county sent a report to several hundred Portland-area health care providers echoing Sidelinger’s warning. The county also urged people to quit vaping and asked health care providers to watch for more cases. The warning came days after Multnomah County commissioners said they would work with state and federal officials to ban the sale of flavored nicotine products.

As Worldwide Smoking Rates Fall, Africa’s Shoot Up — With Deadly Consequences 
.W 
Globally, smoking rates are decreasing, but in many lower and middle income countries, African nations among them, rates are increasing. WHO data show a steep rise in smoking in many African countries, with many 5-year projected increases at 5% and more.i A proven public health strategy, harm reduction refers to policies, regulations, and actions that reduce health risks by providing safer forms of hazardous products or encouraging less risky behaviors, rather than simply banning them. Partnering with the information dissemination project, Tobacco Harm Reduction Malawi, and the newly launched Campaign for Safer Alternativesbased in Kenya, the GSTHR report’s publishers presented global findings on tobacco harm reduction, showing that many smokers have switched to safer products and dramatically reduced the risks associated with smoking. “We need to halt the dramatic rises in smoking rates in Africa which are predicted by WHO,” asserted Professor Gerry Stimson, Director of Knowledge∙Action∙Change and Emeritus Professor at Imperial College London. “Most smokers want to quit smoking, but they find it hard to stop using nicotine. Around the world, millions of lives depend on both consumer and government acceptance of safer alternatives to smoking.” Chimwemwe Ngoma, Project Manager, Tobacco Harm Reduction Malawi and holder of a Global Tobacco Harm Reduction Scholarship, declared: “Tobacco Harm Reduction Malawi believes that all citizens of Malawi should be informed of the health consequences, addictive nature, and mortal threat posed by tobacco consumption and exposure to tobacco smoke. Malawians should be able to make more informed public and personal choices, including having access to safer nicotine products, to enable them to live longer and healthier lives.” Joseph Magero, Chair of the Campaign for Safer Alternatives and holder of a Global Tobacco Harm Reduction Scholarship, noted: “Society’s relationship with tobacco and nicotine is changing due to developments in technology, such as vapes and other safer nicotine products. The Campaign for Safer Alternatives has formally launched this week to ensure more people across East Africa receive accurate information on alternatives to smoking. By arming people with information, we can finally begin to curb the tobacco epidemic.” The No Fire, No Smoke – Global State of Tobacco Harm Reduction 2018 report and this press release are published by Knowledge∙Action∙Change, a private sector public health agency based in the United Kingdom. i The graphic entitled African region – increasing daily tobacco prevalence trends can be downloaded and reproduced with credit to GSTHR at https://gsthr.org/images/charts/chapter2/2.5.jpgii March 13-14, 2019, Golden Peacock Hotel, Lilongwe, Malawi.

Tobacco Smoke Residue Can Become Airborne Again Indoors 
.W 
Residue from tobacco smoke can end up in indoor air even in nonsmoking spaces. Prawitr Sae Wa Ni/EyeEm / Getty Images Originally published on May 9, 2018 3:20 pm You might be breathing chemical residue from tobacco smoke in indoor spaces where no one has smoked for years. This was the surprise finding of a new study published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances. Researchers at Drexel University in Philadelphia found that chemicals left on clothing, furniture and other surfaces by tobacco smoke – known as thirdhand smoke — can become airborne and travel through a building's ventilation system. The researchers measured the air composition in a non-smoking, unoccupied classroom over the course of a month using an aerosol mass spectrometer. They initially wanted to see what happens to outdoor air particles when they come inside. But they kept noticing a chemical signature that was only indoors and not outdoors. They discovered it consisted of chemicals from thirdhand smoke — and made up 29 percent of the air mass in the room. "To add that much additional mass through one type of process is pretty large," says Peter DeCarlo, associate professor of environmental engineering and chemistry at Drexel and lead author on the study. "We didn't expect this at all." DeCarlo and his team looked into the mechanism that would allow compounds from tobacco smoke to end up in a room that hadn't allowed smoking in at least 20 to 25 years. What they discovered was that thirdhand smoke compounds were effectively hitching a ride on tiny particles in the air. The classroom they studied happened to be 20 meters down the hall from a balcony where people would sneak out for an unauthorized smoke. The room was also located near an office space where several smokers worked; that space shares the same HVAC system as the classroom in question. Though they could not identify the exact source, the researchers suspect the thirdhand smoke from these smokers made its way into the classroom and stuck to surfaces there. The compounds were then exposed to another chemical — possibly ammonia from people's breath or skin, or even cleaning products — and became gaseous again. "The chemistry of this is very interesting," says Neal Benowitz, professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco and a leader of the California Consortium on Thirdhand Smoke. He says scientists have known for some time that the nicotine levels in walls and furniture can persist for years. "What this study shows is that thirdhand smoke moves around the room," he says. The Drexel researchers suggest that after becoming gaseous again, smoke residue compounds can attach themselves to tiny air particles that come inside through a building's HVAC system, which in summer months pulls in outside air and chills it. That cooling process condenses water vapor in the air, which primes those outside particles — which can come from everything from car exhaust to power plant emissions — to react with thirdhand smoke gasses. Once the chemicals attach themselves to the air particles, the building's air distribution carries those chemicals throughout the building, including to the classroom researchers studied. All this means people could be unwittingly exposed to thirdhand smoke in higher volumes than previously thought — even in locations where smoking has been verboten for years. The Drexel researchers took their measurements in August 2014, at a time when the building's air conditioning unit was in heavy use. They confirmed the findings in the lab, and repeated the experiment in August 2016 with the same results. However, when they repeated the experiment in winter months, they found no thirdhand smoke compounds in the room, showing that the cooling of outside air was key for their uptake into the air. There aren't good data on the health effects of thirdhand smoke on humans. Studies have shown liver problems and metabolic issues in mice, but the area of study is relatively new when compared to the more established literature on secondhand smoke, for which the level of exposure to harmful chemicals is much greater than thirdhand smoke. However, Benowitz added, secondhand smoke exposure is usually limited to the time a smoker is in the room — a matter of minutes. "With thirdhand smoke, there is a constant source of exposure, day after day after day," he says. The findings could lead to further research on thirdhand smoke exposure from e-cigarettes. They don't contain many of the toxic chemicals produced by combustible cigarettes, but do contain nicotine, which can become airborne. DeCarlo hopes to do future studies on the impact both of vaping and of thirdhand smoke uptake in the home, where the ventilation systems are different than the ones used in commercial and office buildings. "Certainly I think this [study] needs to be considered when we think about how we are keeping our nonsmoking spaces as smoke-free as possible," he says. "How exactly it's combatted I think is going to be up for debate." Benowitz is currently looking for biomarkers to measure how much thirdhand smoke exposure a person has had. That will help with future studies about the exact impact thirdhand smoke has on humans. "It's difficult to study due to the overlap between secondhand smoke and thirdhand smoke," he says. But he adds, "It's certainly a concern and explains how people can be exposed to these chemicals even when they aren't regularly around smokers."

Nicotine chemistry, metabolism, kinetics and biomarkers. 
.W 
Nicotine underlies tobacco addiction, influences tobacco use patterns, and is used as a pharmacological aid to smoking cessation. The absorption, distribution and disposition characteristics of nicotine from tobacco and medicinal products are reviewed. Nicotine is metabolized primarily by the liver enzymes CYP2A6, UDPglucuronosyltransferase (UGT), and flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO). In addition to genetic factors, nicotine metabolism is influenced by diet and meals, age, sex, use of estrogen-containing hormone preparations, pregnancy and kidney disease, other medications, and smoking itself. Substantial racial/ethnic differences are observed in nicotine metabolism, which are likely influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. The most widely used biomarker of nicotine intake is cotinine, which may be measured in blood, urine, saliva, hair, or nails. The current optimal plasma cotinine cut-point to distinguish smokers from non-smokers in the general US population is 3 ng ml(-1). This cut-point is much lower than that established 20 years ago, reflecting less secondhand smoke exposure due to clear air policies and more light or occasional smoking.

‘World leading’ health bill passes in Wales 
.W 
A ‘radical’ health bill banning smoking on hospital grounds, school grounds and public playgrounds has been passed by the National Assembly of Wales. The decision has been welcomed by the BMA’s Welsh Council, who said it makes Wales a ‘world leader’ in public health policy.  The wide-ranging Public Health (Wales) Billwas voted through by Assembly Members on Tuesday 16 May. In addition to banning smoking in certain places, it prohibits tobacco and nicotine products from being handed to under 18s by home delivery or collection services, and will see the creation of a national register of tobacco/nicotine retailers.  The Bill also passes the following points into law:  Creating a mandatory licensing scheme for ‘special procedures’, namely acupuncture, body piercing, electrolysis and tattooing, and prohibiting the intimate piercing of anybody under the age of 18  Placing a duty on local authorities to prepare and publish a local toilets strategy, including an assessment of the need for toilets for public use and details of how that need will be met  Requiring public bodies in Wales to assess how their decisions will affect people’s physical and mental health  Making the planning of pharmacy services more responsive to the needs of local communities  Placing a duty on the Welsh government to produce a national strategy on preventing and reducing obesity.  Dr Phil Banfield, chair of the BMA’s Welsh Council, welcomed the decision: “This legislation positions Wales as a world leader in the application public health policy.”  He added that the bill “highlights the importance of taking a proactive and joined-up approach to tackling the causes of obesity and measures that can be taken to reduce them.”  In the run up to the vote, Minister for Social Services and Public Health Rebecca Evans said: “The Public Health (Wales) Bill is the latest in a long line of measures the Welsh government has introduced to improve the health and wellbeing of the people of Wales.  “It has a particular focus on promoting children and younger people’s health. Proposals such as the ban on smoking in school grounds, childcare settings and playgrounds are intended to prevent children from being exposed to smoking behaviours, making it less likely that they’ll take up smoking themselves.”  Contents  Quick Links  Help and Info  Communications International Group  The largest, most experienced publisher in the UK pharmacy sector  CIG is the UK's leading provider of sector-specific news and training, publishing 15 healthcare and beauty titles including Pharmacy Magazine, Training Matters, P3, Independent Community Pharmacist and Beauty Magazine.

Hawaii Gets An F For Keeping E-Cigarette Flavors Within Kids' Reach - Honolulu 
.W 
Hawaii got an A for keeping public spaces free of smoke but earned an F for failing to prevent access to flavored tobacco products such as menthol cigarettes and fruity-flavored electronic cigarettes, according to a report by the American Lung Association. While cigarette smoking has fallen to record lows in recent years due to a raft of tobacco control laws and gruesome yet effective public information campaigns, advocates and officials warn Hawaii and the nation remain in the grips of a “vaping epidemic” among high school students and young adults. “We saw our state being one of the best in tobacco use in youth – in 20 years, a lot of that has been eroded by vaping,” said Pedro Haro, executive director of the American Lung Association in Hawaii. “The new generation of adult tobacco users could be really astronomical in the cost of disease and death to the state.” The American Lung Association released its 2022 tobacco control report card for Hawaii, with scores ranging from an A for smoke-free air to an F for limiting flavored tobacco. Courtesy: Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids/2021 The 20th annual “State of Tobacco Control” report, published Wednesday, examines the tobacco use policies of all 50 states and the District of Columbia, giving letter grades in five categories: smoke-free air, program funding, tobacco taxes, quitting services and flavor restrictions. Hawaii was early to ban smoking in most public areas, Haro said, including in restaurants and bars, government and private workplaces, state parks and within 20 feet of entrances, exits and air vents, and very much deserves its lone A grade, Haro said. “The state really had a comprehensive law established back in 2006,” Haro said. “There’s very few people that are exposed to secondhand smoke through their work, which is really the foresight of legislators and advocates at the time bringing this forward.” But despite its early success investing in smoke-free air and being the first state to raise the legal smoking age to 21, Hawaii has largely failed to prevent a new generation of teenagers from riding the wave of e-cigarettes, Haro said. Driven by viral “vape” brands such as Juul, Vuse and NJOY, e-cigarettes have exploded in popularity since the 2010s. Lured by kid-friendly flavors with names like Frozen Lime Drop and Hawaiian POG — a take on island-favorite Passion Orange Guava — rates of vaping among Hawaii high school students tripled from 10% in 2013 to 33% in 2019, according to the Hawaii Youth Tobacco Survey. Hawaii high school vaping rates of 10% were more than double the 4.5% national average in 2013, although mainland numbers have since caught up, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System. There are flavorless and tobacco-scented e-cigarettes available, but youth overwhelmingly choose the fun flavors. Of the 85% of young U.S. users who opted for flavored vapes in 2021, the FDA found 72% frequented the fruity flavors, while around 30% reported using the candy/dessert, mint and menthol flavors, respectively. Flavored e-cigarettes are still readily available in-stores and online, as in this screenshot of Sand Island based e-cigarette shop Volcano’s website. Screenshot/2022 Yet despite this data, Hawaii currently has no law to target youth vaping by regulating the sale of flavored e-cigarettes, resulting in its failing grade in the ALA report card. This is not for lack of trying – in the 2021 legislative session alone, lawmakers introduced at least six bills banning flavored tobacco from stores, in whole or in part. Five died in committee; the last, House Bill 826, made it through the House before the Senate amended it to exempt menthol-flavored tobacco products. House lawmakers disagreed, and the measure died. “I know the conventional wisdom would say, ‘let’s get rid of the pineapple and the juicy fruits or whatever, obviously, child targeting flavors,’” Haro said. “But the data shows that menthol is one of the most preferred flavors for youth, including Hawaii.” There are federal limits on certain flavored tobacco products, however, regulations are patchwork in nature and riddled with loopholes. For example, a Trump-era Food and Drug Administration policy banned most flavors of cartridge-based e-cigarettes but stopped short of curtailing flavors for disposable and other e-cigarette varieties. Today, disposable e-cigarette line Puff Bar has become the favorite brand among youth, and flavored vapes and vape-refills remain readily available online and in-stores, a December 2021 Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids report found, leaving space for state-level intervention. “States and cities cannot wait for the FDA and must act now to close the gaps left by the FDA in order to fully protect kids,” the report wrote. While the e-cigarette industry and some public health experts maintain that vaping helps smokers quit the more-toxic cigarettes and, therefore, needs less regulation, opponents have pointed to signs of long-term lung illness and the potential for e-cigarettes to act as a “gateway” to nicotine addiction, especially among younger users. In a 2016 survey of adult Hawaii e-cigarette users, 40% of respondents reported they had never smoked cigarettes before vaping. Another 21% continued to smoke regularly, while 12% said they started using cigarettes after they began vaping. Besides its bookend-scores for limiting secondhand smoke and flavored tobacco, the ALA gave Hawaii a C for the taxes the state levees on various tobacco products and a C in its funding of tobacco control programs, with the state allocating just 62.6% of the $13.7 million recommended by the CDC, which calculates the amount according to the number of smokers in the state. The state fared better in public access to tobacco cessation services, receiving a B for a well-funded tobacco quit line and treatment covered by the state’s Med-Quest Medicaid plan. The primary issue, Haro said, was the absence of a state mandate requiring private insurers to pay for these services. “We just need that initial leadership to show again,” Haro said. “We need that initial spark to pass the legislation, allow the advocates to work with the communities to … finally see those tobacco numbers reduce.” Sign up for our FREE morning newsletter Sorry.

NEWS: Report: Industry Targeting Continues to Harm the Black Community 
.W 
April 9th, 2021 The Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids released a report in February explaining how the targeted marketing of menthol products by the tobacco industry has harmed Black communities. Tobacco industry targeting through marketing, event sponsorships, and retail promotions has caused smoking rates of menthol cigarettes among Black Americans to climb consistently for 60+ years. Menthol cigarettes are even more harmful than other cigarettes, in part due to the fact that menthol masks the harsh taste of tobacco and is easier to inhale deeply. This has led to more young people using menthol, a more intense addiction, and even more difficulty quitting.. Tobacco use, specifically menthol products, is a major contributor to three leading causes of death among Black Americans: heart disease, cancer and stroke. The report also includes the following key findings: In the 1950s, less than 10% of Black people who smoke used menthol cigarettes; today, 85% of Black people who smoke use menthol. Menthol cigarettes continue to be heavily advertised, widely available, and priced cheaper in Black communities. The cooling mint flavor of menthol numbs the throat and reduces the harshness of tobacco smoke, making menthol cigarettes more appealing and easier to use.As a result, menthol cigarettes increase the number of youth and young adults who experiment with cigarettes and become smokers. Young people who start smoking menthol cigarettes are more likely to become addicted and long-term daily smokers. The report is supported by 11 organizations that advocate for tobacco-free communities and health equity for Black communities nationwide.

Pub landlord urges you to quit - The Argus 
.W 
A PUB landlord might not be the most obvious abstinence campaigner but comedian Al Murray gave an anti-smoking campaign a boost during a flying visit.  Alastair James Hay Murray, or Pub Landlord Al Murray as he is known to thousands of comedy fans, gave his backing to Crawley Borough Council’s Stoptober campaign as he visited the town on his latest tour.  The national campaign encourages smokers to quit smoking for 28 days and last year more than 2,000 West Sussex residents attempted to quit.  Mr Murray was on stage at The Hawth in Crawley for his One Man One Guvnor tour on the first day of Stoptober and posed for photos with Councillor Chris Oxlade, the borough council’s cabinet member for community engagement and wellbeing officer Matt Laird.  This year, the Stop Smoking Service is offering free support for those giving up and can be contacted on 0300 1001823 or visit www.smokefreewestsussex.co.uk.

E-cigs: Helping or hurting? 
.W 
Posted: Aug 1, 2019 / 06:26 PM CDT / Updated: Aug 1, 2019 / 06:26 PM CDT SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (KELO) — One month ago, South Dakota implemented a ban on using electronic smoking devices in public places and workplaces. As regulations on vaping products continue across the country, a recent study in the journal of Substance Abuse & Misuse raises concerns that people may smoke more tobacco and vape less. As certain vaping flavors are taken off the shelves and bans are put in place experts say e-cig options are becoming limited. Sandra Williams-Luther, owner of Blown Away Vape in Sioux Falls says the tobacco industry is playing a big role in shining a negative light on vaping. “I’ve been watching the trend a lot. Even San Francisco has banned all e-cigarette devices even and I think it’s a way, they’re going backwards,” Sandra Williams-Luther said. “There was just one of these articles that I received that said patients that use an e-cigarette daily are 77 percent more likely to quit smoking than patients that don’t use an e-cigarette. However, they’re switching from one nicotine delivery device to another,” Dr. Anthony Hericks said. Dr. Hericks with Avera Health says inhaling nicotine in a tobacco cigarette or e-cig can cause health issues, and because e-cigs aren’t regulated it’s hard to determine exactly what types of health issues to expect without more research. But even with that in mind, Hericks says making the switch from tobacco cigarettes to e-cigs is beneficial. “I think using an e-cigarette as a way to quit smoking is very, very good thing to do. I think the problem is you have to have a plan,” Hericks said. Just like using a nicotine patch or gum, Hericks says there must be a plan to wean yourself off of the nicotine completely. But as e-cig regulations grow Williams-Luther has concerns that quitting tobacco with the help of e-cigs could become difficult. “The tobacco industry has killed thousands of thousands of people and yet they can walk into a store, buy cigarettes for 6 bucks a pack and now they want to ban something that helps people,” Williams-Luther said. Sandra says about half of her customers are former smokers who’ve quit, and since then turned to vaping. “It is a great way to quit smoking and the people that do come back, some of them quit altogether. They quit e-cigarettes altogether, they don’t need it anymore. Some of them use it occasionally, when they feel that urge because like I said it is a really hard habit to leave behind you,” Williams-Luther said. While Hericks says e-cigs could be helpful in quitting tobacco, he says all non-smokers, young adults, and women trying to become pregnant should avoid all e-cig products. Williams-Luther says Blown Away Vape is against underage use of e-cigarette products and does not allow anyone under the age of 18 to purchase any products from her store. To take a look at South Dakota’s current e-cigarette regulations, click here. Statement from Rob Cool, Owner of Yocan USA in Sioux Falls: To begin I think it is helpful to explain who we are. We started as an online vape retailer back in 2013. We quickly moved into nationwide distribution and wholesale of vape and smoke shop products. In the last year we have opened up to local retail because people kept calling asking if they could visit our shop (which was actually a warehouse). I mention this because I think it makes us pretty uniquely positioned to speak on the issues you are looking at. While South Dakota has not implemented a flavor ban or vaping tax we serve vape shops in states where those things have occurred. Our average customer is over 30 and looking to quit smoking. 96% of our customers choose a flavor other than tobacco or mint/menthol to help them quit smoking. The vast majority of our customers who use an e-cig to quit smoking use a ‘flavored’ vape product. In states with significant vaping taxes, like Vermont (92% vaping tax), what we have seen is a significant slowdown in vaping adoption. Vaping is normally about 80% cheaper than smoking. Adding significant taxes reduces or negates the cost advantage. While they may not push people back to smoking, vaping taxes do significantly slow down the adoption rate at which people move from smoking to vaping. Flavor bans on the other hand are another matter. In markets with flavor bans we have seen fairly catastrophic results. Vape sales drop significantly and shops close. It is difficult to get hard data but anecdotal feedback from our wholesale customers indicates many of their customers gave up on vaping when they did not have access to flavors they found attractive. People stop attempting to make the switch, and those that have made the switch already often move to out of state online suppliers in order to continue to receive the flavors they enjoy. The FDA has proposed (March 13, 2019 statement from Scott Gottlieb) that flavored e-cig products be sold only in adult-only settings, like vape shops, and we fully support that. We strongly believe this is an effective method to combat any temptation flavored products might present to kids while still allowing adult smokers reasonable access to the single most successful smoking cessation device in history. While vaping research in the US is often partisan and paid for by groups with specific agendas the UK’s NHS has done a significant amount of independent vaping research. Their studies indicate that while people trying nicotine gum have less than a 9% success rate in stopping smoking, e-cig users enjoy an almost 80% success rate. The UK’s NHS also estimates e-cigs are 95% safer than smoking. Taxes on cigarettes are meant to offset increased healthcare costs and discourage harmful behavior. Applying the same taxes to products that successfully reduce that harm seems counterproductive. Most news stories seem to talk about e-cigs not being 100% safe. We agree. Vaping is about harm reduction, not the total elimination of harm. If someone can simply quit smoking we encourage it. If someone doesn’t smoke we don’t encourage them to start vaping as a fun hobby. For those who can’t stop smoking on their own, e-cigs provide a realistic path to a less harmful lifestyle. Flavors are an important element in helping many adults stop smoking and reduce the harm presented by carcinogens present in cigarette smoke. Copyright 2019 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.

Utah Senate votes against proposal to raise age to purchase tobacco from 19 to 21 
.W 
SALT LAKE CITY — Utah legislators have killed a proposal that could have made their state the first to raise the age for legal tobacco purchases to 21.  The bill's sponsor, Republican state Sen. Stuart Reid, had urged support for the measure so Utah could "set the example and make a statement to the nation."  Similar measures have been introduced in Colorado, New Jersey, Massachusetts and Hawaii this year. None of the measures have come close to becoming law, and it is unclear how many have momentum. Maryland lawmakers rejected a version of the plan last month.  The state-level proposals follow a precedent-setting New York City regulation that put the legal age for tobacco purchases at 21.  Several senators said they're concerned about the negative effects of smoking, but couldn't support the measure.  "When do you become an adult?" asked Sen. Todd Weiler, a Woods Cross Republican, on Tuesday. "If you raise it to 21, why not 23? Why not 25? Why not 50?"  The Utah Senate voted 12-16 against the bill Monday, arguing that the proposal infringes on the rights of legal adults to purchase a legal product.  Reid, of Ogden, had said the proposal would bring the smoking age in line with the legal age to purchase and drink alcohol.  He said that smoking had no value and that "when we identify something of no inherent value, we put limitations on it."  Reid also said his bill could prevent young people from becoming addicted to tobacco because it delays their access to it.  Opponents of his bill argued there's no evidence to support that.  Utah already is among a four states that ban sales for those younger than 19, instead of 18.  In November, New York City became the first large city to ban tobacco sales to people younger than 21.  Utah has the nation's lowest smoking rate, about 12 percent in 2011, the most recent year statistics are available, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Of the roughly 200,000 smokers in Utah, almost 90 percent started before age 18, according to the most recent report from Utah Department of Health's Tobacco Prevention and Control Program.  Reid's bill would have been effective in 2016, which he said gives the 18-, 19- and 20-year-olds who already smoke enough time to reach the new minimum age.

FDA Action on Flavored E-Cigarettes - More Action Needed! 
.W 
FDA Action on Flavored E-Cigarettes - More Action Needed! On September 9, the FDA announced that it had denied marketing applications for most flavored e-cigarettes, recognizing the role of flavored e-cigarettes in attracting youth. However, the FDA will leave our kids at risk unless it acts quickly on the remaining applications, including for products like Juul that have driven the youth e-cigarette epidemic, and eliminates all flavored e-cigarettes, including menthol-flavored products that are widely used by kids. Every day these products remain on the market, our kids remain in jeopardy. To truly protect kids and end the youth e-cigarette epidemic, the FDA must act swiftly to clear the market of all flavored e-cigarettes, including menthol. Why is it so critical for the FDA to act quickly on the remaining e-cigarette application? There is no public health justification for the FDA to allow the continued sale of any flavored e-cigarettes, including menthol-flavored products. There is overwhelming evidence that flavored e-cigarettes – including menthol products – appeal to kids and have fueled the youth e-cigarette epidemic, while there is a lack of evidence that flavored e-cigarettes are effective at helping smokers quit. Of the 3.6 million U.S. kids who use e-cigarettes, 83% report using flavored products and over 1 million use menthol e-cigarettes, according to the 2020 National Youth Tobacco Survey. The evidence shows that kids quickly migrated to menthol e-cigarettes after mint and other flavored cartridge products were taken off the market. If the FDA authorizes any menthol e-cigarettes, even more kids are likely to use them. There is only limited and inadequate evidence to conclude that e-cigarettes are effective at helping smokers quit.The 2020 Surgeon General’s Report on Smoking Cessation concluded, “there is presently inadequate evidence to conclude that e-cigarettes, in general, increase smoking cessation.” The World Health Organization reached a similar conclusion in a July 2021 report, finding that “evidence on the use of ENDS [electronic nicotine delivery systems] as a cessation aid is inconclusive.” The evidence is even weaker that flavored e-cigarettes, including menthol-flavored products, are effective at helping smokers quit. The Juul products pending before the FDA put kids doubly at risk. Not only do they come in menthol flavor attractive to kids, these products also have high nicotine levels – equivalent to a whole pack of cigarettes – that can rapidly addict kids. The FDA cannot allow these highly addictive, menthol-flavored Juul products to stay on the market. But Juul’s menthol e-cigarettes are not the only issue. Other menthol cigarettes such as blu and Reynolds American’s Vuse are also important. Because of the delays and gaps in the FDA’s actions, it is critical that states and cities step up their efforts to eliminate ALL flavored e-cigarettes, as well as other flavored tobacco products.

Why You Should Kick Smoking to the Curb 
.W 
Did you know that ac­cording to the American Lung Association, cigarette smoking is the num­ber one cause of preventable disease and death worldwide? Not many people can say they do.  As stated on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website, in 2011, an estimated 43.8 million adults in the United States were current smokers. Although men tend to smoke more than women, cigarette smoking claims more than 440,000 Ameri­can lives each year.  In addition, smoking costs the United States an average of $193 billion, including $96 billion in direct health care expenditures and $97 billion in lost pro­ductivity. This means that smoking costs an average of $4,260 per adult smoker, per year. Imagine what a per­son could do with that much money, if they weren’t spending it on smoking.  According to the American Lung As­sociation, “cigarette smoke contains over 4,800 chemicals, 69 of which are known to cause cancer.”  Not only do cigarettes contain chemicals such as nicotine, which make them highly addictive, but tobacco by itself can have a serious effect on a regular smoker.  As confirmed on the World Health Orga­nization website, “tobacco use is one of the main risk factors for a number of chronic diseases, including cancer, lung diseases, and cardiovascular diseases.”  Despite these findings however, tobacco still remains very common throughout the world. Although a number of countries have legislation restricting tobacco advertising, regulating who can purchase cigarettes, where people are allowed to smoke, and increasing the cost of cigarettes, people are still giving in to the costly habit.  It is important to understand that even though smoking is directly responsible for approximately 90 percent of lung cancer deaths and approximately 80-90 percent of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), secondhand smoking can be just as damaging to a person’s health.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website, approxi­mately 46,000 nonsmokers in the United States die from heart disease each year, along with an estimated 3,400 annual lung cancer deaths among adult nonsmokers. Not only this, but nonsmokers who are exposed to secondhand smoke at home or work in­crease their lung cancer risk by 20-30 per­cent.  Although some of these numbers can come off as being pretty intimidating, it is reassuring to know that there are a number of resources available to smokers that can help them kick the habit. These resources are very beneficial b e c a u s e not only do smokers become physically addicted to nicotine, but they also link smoking with many social ac­tivities, thus making smoking an even more difficult addiction to break.  As stated on the American Lung Asso­ciation website, there are seven medications approved by the US Food and Drug Admin­istration to aid in quitting smoking. These include over-the-counter nicotine patches, nicotine gum, and nicotine lozenges, nico­tine nasal spray and inhaler (which are available by prescription), and Zyban and Chantix (which are non-nicotine pills).  Not only are there medications avail­able to help people quit smoking, but there are numerous different types of counseling to help current smokers as well. This in­cludes individual, group, or telephone – all of which have been proven to be effective. Often times, the combination of using a medication and counseling is even more ef­fective than just doing one or the other.  Quitting smoking often requires mul­tiple attempts, so it is important to stick to it. If you truly want to live a healthier life­style, perseverance is key. For many people it doesn’t happen overnight, so keep going!

BATB’s road-show halted in BUET for anti-tobacco protestors DHAKA: The campus-based road-show ‘Battle of Minds 2017’ has been halted at the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) following protest of the anti-tobacco platforms. Different anti-tobacco organizations staged demonstration on the BUET premise in the morning on Wednesday (October 25) and demanded stopping of the illegal campaign of the tobacco company-- British American Tobacco Bangladesh (BATB). The anti-tobacco organizations who joined the demonstration include Pratyasha, Aid Foundation, ACLAB, WBB Trust, Campaign for Tobacco Free- Kids (CTFK), Bangladesh Anti Tobacco Alliance (BATA), Tamak Birodhi Nari Jote (TABINAJ), Dhaka Ahsania Mission, Tobacco Control and Research Cell (TCRC) and PROGGA. Earlier, the Tobacco Industry Watch BD PROGGA on October 03 asked to stop the BoM 2017, warning to forge movement if the is not stopped. With the excuse of employment, the British American Tobacco Bangladesh like the previous years started the campaign “Battle of Mind 2017” on October 10. The BATB has been organizing road-shows in different universities to promote its campaign. The tobacco company has been organizing this death-marketing event since 2004 to attract youths in smoking and influence the policymakers. According to the Section 5 (C) of Smoking and Tobacco Products (Control) Act, 2005 (Amended 2013), application of tobacco company name, sign, logo, trademark for arranging such competitions, sponsoring or awarding is completely banned. If the section of the law is violated, a monetary fine not exceeding TK 100,000 or simple imprisonment not less than three month or the both is applicable. Stopping of ‘Battle of Minds 2017’ was necessary to protect the youths from the clutch of this multinational tobacco company- BATB in Bangladesh. All rights reserved.

California declares electronic cigarettes a health threat 
.W 
SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California health officials Wednesday declared electronic cigarettes a health threat that should be strictly regulated like tobacco products, joining other states and health advocates across the U.S. in seeking tighter controls as "vaping" grows in popularity.  The California Department of Public Health released a report saying e-cigarettes emit cancer-causing chemicals and get users hooked on nicotine but acknowledging that more research needs to be done to determine the immediate and long-term health effects.  "E-cigarettes are not as harmful as conventional cigarettes, but e-cigarettes are not harmless" said California Health Officer Ron Chapman. "They are not safe."  New generations of young people will become nicotine addicts if the products remain largely unregulated, Chapman said. Last year, 17 percent of high school seniors reported using e-cigarettes, known as vaping, according to the report.  "Without action, it is likely that California's more than two decades of progress to prevent and reduce traditional tobacco use will erode as e-cigarettes re-normalize smoking behavior," the report says.  E-cigarettes heat liquid nicotine into inhalable vapor without the tar and other chemicals found in traditional cigarettes. A cartridge of nicotine can cost anywhere from $5 to $20 dollars and can be reused.  California banned the sale of e-cigarettes to minors in 2010, but the report raises concerns about children consuming liquid nicotine with flavors such as cotton candy and gummy bear. Reports of children under 5 with e-cigarette poisoning jumped from seven in 2012 to 154 last year.  The California report says e-cigarettes emit as many as 10 toxic chemicals, but advocates say there is no evidence those substances are released at dangerous levels.  "Despite the health officer's false claims, there is ample evidence that vaping helps smokers quit and is far less hazardous than smoking," Gregory Conley, president of the e-cigarette advocacy group American Vaping Association, said in an email. "Smokers deserve truthful and accurate information about the relative risks of different nicotine products, not hype and conjecture based on cherry-picked reports."  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is also proposing regulations that include warning labels and ingredient lists on e-cigarettes, although enactment could take years. California health officials are calling for restrictions on the marketing and sale of e-cigarettes and protections against accidental ingestion of liquid nicotine.  A state senator introduced legislation this week that would regulate e-cigarettes as tobacco products and ban their use in public places such as hospitals, bars and schools. A similar bill was defeated last year over opposition from tobacco companies.  Chapman, the health official, would not take a position on specific legislation, but said his department would be rolling out an e-cigarette awareness campaign with possible television and radio advertisements.  E-cigarettes have become more visible as they grow in popularity and commercials for the products air in places where traditional cigarette ads have been banned. Businesses related to e-cigarettes, including vaping lounges, are rapidly popping up in cities across California.  Geoff Braithwaite, co-owner of an Oakland store that sells liquid nicotine for e-cigarettes, said he understands the need to restrict vaping in public and prevent sales to minors. He says his customers are longtime smokers who should be able to get a nicotine buzz without the harshness of a regular cigarette.  "Nicotine has all this stigma attached solely to the medium we used to use," Braithwaite said. "When you try to outright ban e-cigarettes, you're lumping in the solution with the problem."  Other states, including Oklahoma, Tennessee and Arkansas, already have issued advisories cautioning the use of e-cigarettes. Legislatures have been exploring restrictions on e-cigarette marketing, adding childproof packaging requirements and imposing taxes to discourage use.  "Health officials want to be proactive on this important public health issue," said Lisa Waddell, who leads community health and prevention at the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. "The issue of real concern here is we really don't know everything that's in these products, and you are seeing the rise of the use of these products in our children as well as our adults."

Judge says FDA must issue cigarette graphic health warning by 2020 
.W 
Indira Talwani, a US district judge in Boston, said the FDA has until March 2020 to issue a rule that will require graphic health warnings on packs and in advertising of cigarettes. The judge rejected the agency's proposal to complete the long-delayed final ruling by March 2021, saying the FDA missed a deadline that would have completed the rule by 2015. Related Summaries Bills that would expand vaccine exemptions for children and require health providers to offer more vaccination risk information have been proposed in at least 20 states this year despite ongoing measles outbreaks across the US, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. "The volume of legislative activity is greater than in past years. ... But averse bills outnumbering supportive ones conforms with trends from prior years," the AAP said. Tandem Diabetes Care will release by the end of the month a software update to address an anomaly associated with continuous glucose monitoring data handling by its t:slim X2 insulin pump and its Control-IQ technology under certain conditions. The company found the anomaly in a trial of Control-IQ, where use of the software feature will be suspended until an update is released to the study sites. Draft guidance released by Health Canada provides information on the content, structure, and assembly and system requirements for medtech regulatory activities, with content incorporated from the International Medical Device Regulators Forum's Table of Contents documents and regional guidance. The agency intends to adopt the IMDRF's TOC formats next month and will implement an experience-based consultation for the guidance, accepting feedback until March 31, 2020, before finalizing the document. More than 47,600 food facilities were deleted from the FDA's database because they failed to renew registrations by the end of 2018, a requirement of the Food Safety Modernization Act. The agency now has registrations for 186,016 facilities, half of which are outside the country. Six Defense Department employees who sued the FDA, HHS and the Pentagon over the military's anthrax vaccination policy will appeal a federal judge's decision to dismiss their case. The plaintiffs claim that the FDA ruled on the vaccine based on studies of animals instead of humans, but a Defense Department spokeswoman said several medical experts have validated the efficacy and safety of the anthrax vaccine.

Federal Government Sends Warning To Vaping Companies 
.W 
Two U.S. government agencies are warning companies that sell vaping products that their packaging resembles candy and may be in violation of safety and marketing guidelines because of its possible appeal to teens and children. Food and Drug Administration Listen Listening... / Originally published on May 2, 2018 6:25 am The Food and Drug Administration and Federal Trade Commission on Tuesday sent warning letters to 13 manufacturers, distributors and retailers of e-cigarette liquids. In a phone briefing for reporters, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said the companies are endangering kids by marketing the products to resemble juice boxes, cookies or candy. "You look at the lollipop for example. I don't see how my 4- or 5-year-old doesn't just look at that and see a lollipop. It's a lollipop," he said. E-liquids are used in electronic cigarettes, and they often use nicotine which can cause illness — even death — if ingested by a small child. Products targeted have names like Smurf Sauce and V'Nilla Cookies & Milk. "These are being deliberately designed in ways that they can be just mistakenly confused by a child," Gottlieb said in the briefing. The agencies cited recent national data of thousands of nicotine exposures in kids younger than 6, who accidentally ingested the vaping liquid. The letters and violations vary somewhat by company but, overall, the letters say the products' appeal to minors violates parts of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, which gives the FDA authority over marketing and distributing tobacco products. "Today's announcement should send a clear signal that companies selling these products have a responsibility to insure they aren't putting children in harm's way or enticing youth use," Gottlieb said. He warned more actions would be coming. Jameson Rodgers is vice president of business development for California-based NEwhere Inc., one of the companies that received a letter. He says his company's products are only for adults who want to switch to vaping from traditional cigarettes, which he says are less healthful. The FDA targeted the company's One Mad Hit Juice Box e-liquid. Rodgers says the company voluntarily removed it from distribution last year. "We definitely didn't intend to position it as a product that would appeal to anybody who wasn't of legal smoking age," he says, though he admits it might have sent a "questionable" message. "Really would you buy a product, a vape with the name Dancing Monkey or Cotton Candy? At the end of the day we're trying to create products that have the ability to compete against Big Tobacco," he says. According to its website, TVECA is a nonprofit dedicated to "create a sensible and responsible electronic cigarette market" by providing education, communication and research to media, lawmakers and consumers. Tuesday's warning letters are part of a larger push by the federal government to crack down on youth access to tobacco products, including vaping. Last week the FDA sent a warning letter to 40 retail stores for selling the e-cigarette brand Juul to minors. They also asked the company for research on its appeal to children and teenagers. Health officials say Juul is highly addictive, and it's so new there's scant research about its health effects. The companies targeted Tuesday have 15 days to respond — to either defend their practices or explain how they'll change their labeling, or risk federal action such as fines or prosecution. This story is part of a reporting partnership with NPR, Colorado Public Radio and Kaiser Health News.

Experts are pushing for a tobacco-free world by approximately 2040 
.W 
Leading experts have called for a "turbocharged" global campaign that could lead to a tobacco-free world by 2040.  They warn that despite the decline of smoking in the developed world, tobacco use is expected to increase in some countries over the next decade, notably in Africa and the Middle East.  With global population rising, there could still be more than a billion people smoking in 2025 unless urgent action is taken, it is claimed.  The call to arms in the fight against smoking comes in a series of articles published in the Lancet medical journal and will be launched at the World Conference on Tobacco and Health being held in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.  Professor Robert Beaglehole, from the University of Auckland, New Zealand, who co-led the international group of public health and policy experts, said: "The time has come for the world to acknowledge the unacceptability of the damage being done by the tobacco industry and work towards a world essentially free from the legal and illegal sale of tobacco products.  "A world where tobacco is out of sight, out of mind, and out of fashion - yet not prohibited - is achievable in less than three decades from now, but only with full commitment from governments, international agencies, such as UN and WHO (World Health Organisation), and civil society."  Global tobacco regulation should be "turbocharged", with the United Nations taking a leading role in efforts to eliminate the sale and use of tobacco.  The experts pointed out that falling demand for tobacco in rich parts of the world had caused the "big four" tobacco companies to turn their attention to low and middle-income countries.  Their alleged tactics included industrial litigation, lobbying through third-party groups, and covert maintenance of political pressure disguised as "corporate social responsibility".  Professor Anna Gilmore, another of the authors from the University of Bath, said: "Contrary to industry claims, tobacco marketing deliberately targets women and young people.  "The tobacco industry continues to interfere with governments' efforts to implement effective tobacco control policies. If the world is to become tobacco free, it's vital that the industry's appalling conduct receives far closer scrutiny and countries which stand up to the industry's bullying tactics receive better global support."  Deborah Arnott, chief executive of the charity Action on Smoking and Health (Ash) said: "Along with many other rich nations, we have made good progress in reducing tobacco use over the past several decades.  "However, one in five UK adults continue to smoke, not through choice but because they are addicted.  "And 100,000 die early each year as a result.  "The authors of the Lancet articles are right that we need to do more to tackle the tobacco industry and to make it pay for the damage it does.  "This is just what the tobacco levy currently being consulted on by HM Treasury could achieve.  "But it is essential that the money raised should be used to encourage smokers to quit and to discourage young people from taking up this deadly habit."

India Says E-cigarette Ban Implies Use Of Devices Also Prohibited 
.W 
The Indian government has told a court that its federal ban on the sale of electronic cigarettes implies that their use is also prohibited, legal documents seen by Reuters showed, in a further clampdown on the devices. Citing health risks, India in September banned the import, manufacture, sale, advertisement, storage and distribution of e-cigarettes, dashing future plans of companies such as U.S.-based Juul Labs and Philip Morris International. India's decision, however, did not ban the use of such devices outright, and a senior Health Ministry official told Reuters after the announcement that e-cigarette use would not be barred. However, in a Nov. 5 filing in a Kolkata court, where the government is defending two legal challenges against the ban, the ministry said it was "completely baseless" to say only the sale and manufacture of e-cigarettes and vaping devices were barred, and not use. "The ordinance is aimed at banning the product. Once the import, production, manufacture, distribution and storage of e-cigarettes is prohibited, it is implied that the use of e-cigarettes is also prohibited," said the court filing, which has been reviewed by Reuters and has not been made public. The Health Ministry official said on Monday the court document was "factually correct", without giving further details due to the court proceedings. The official added the authorities would not take action against the "personal use" of e-cigarettes. The filing, however, has unnerved users, who argue against the ban and say they fear police action if they continue using the devices. "This filing goes against the Health Ministry's announcements that personal use is not banned," said Samrat Chowdhery of Association of Vapers India. He added India should add a clause to its ban order to exclude personal use. India banned the sale of e-cigarettes as it fears they could lead to increased nicotine addiction. Advocates for e-cigarettes say vaping is far less harmful than smoking tobacco. India's 106 million adult smokers, second only to China, make it an attractive market for companies such as Juul, which had plans to launch its device in the country. "As Juul, an e-cigarette giant was entering India and would flood the Indian markets ... (the ban order) became all the more imminent and necessary," the Health Ministry said in one of its court filings.

Top 5 Reasons to Quit Smoking Now from your Northmead Dentist 
.W 
With the theme “Protecting youth from industry manipulation and preventing them from tobacco and nicotine use”, World No Tobacco Day 2020 is here. The team at Smiles First Dental can certainly get behind an event that promotes health! Which is why we’re covering a couple of reasons why quitting smoking, even if you’ve tried before, may be a worthwhile goal. #1. Smokers are 50% more likely to develop gum disease than non-smokers Advanced research has shown smoking has been linked to an increased risk of infection, including gum disease. Gum diseases are often a painful problem which will eventually cause tooth loss. #2. Smoking inhibits your body’s ability to heal Whenever your body undergoes trauma, whether that’s a serious surgery or minor cut, it relies on a robust flow of healthy blood to heal. Smoking, however, restricts blood vessels and diminishes the quantity of blood that moves throughout the system. #3. Tobacco users are 6 times more likely to develop oral cancer While oral cancer can occur in anyone, people that use tobacco are at a way greater risk. Oral cancer can affect the tongue, throat, cheeks, or the other area of the mouth. If caught early oral cancer are often successfully treated. #4. Yellow teeth and bad breath are incredibly common Tobacco products contain tar and nicotine. Both of these ingredients can stick to teeth, gums, and the tongue and are difficult to remove. Because of this, smokers and users of other forms of tobacco usually have discoloured teeth and unpleasant breath. If you are looking for a quick and effective way of getting whiter teeth, a teeth whitening procedure can be done at our dental clinic in Northmead. #5. Tooth loss is 2 times more prevalent in smokers Due to several of other reasons above, like a drier mouth and a decreased ability to heal, smokers are more likely to suffer more tooth loss than non-smokers. Oftentimes, smokers may lose their teeth before their non-using counterparts. This is especially important right now as studies show that smokers have a higher risk of acquiring a severe case of coronavirus. Join us in the fight to become a tobacco-free generation.

City bans tobacco, e-cigarette businesses 
.W 
City bans tobacco, e-cigarette businesses NOEL BRINKERHOFF nbrinkerhoff@americancanyoneagle.com 0 American Canyon currently does not have any smoke shops or tobacco stores, or even ones that exclusively sell e-cigarettes, a popular habit among today’s youth. City leaders decided on Tuesday to keep it this way by adopting an ordinance that prohibits such businesses from opening in the city. The new prohibition, which was nearly a year in the making, was prompted when an entrepreneur approached City Hall early in 2015 about starting a tobacco-related business. The request caught city officials off-guard after realizing the zoning code lacked any language or sections that prevented these businesses in American Canyon. The City Council tackled the problem by first adopting an emergency ordinance that kept the would-be tobacco shop from moving forward, giving council members time to unanimously adopt a permanent ban Tuesday evening. It is the first of its kind in Napa County. “As a city we’ve already taken action to make our parks tobacco-free” and to maintain “a clean healthy environment” in American Canyon, said Councilmember Belia Ramos in supporting the ordinance. Vice Mayor Joan Bennett agreed, saying the development of stores that focus on selling cigarettes was a bad fit for the “family-oriented community.” “There are so many young people who get involved in cigarette use,” said Bennett, who was in favor of discouraging smoking among teenagers or to at least make it harder for them to start. “I’m happy to make them go a few miles down the road” to Vallejo if they really want to smoke or vape, she said.

Bennett was referring to a staff report indicating Vallejo has nearly 20 businesses that cater to tobacco products or the growing e-cigarette and hookah lounge trade. The same report, prepared by Community Development Director Brent Cooper, cited the U.S. Surgeon General while stating “tobacco use is a pediatric epidemic in the United States because 99 percent of all first tobacco use occurs by age 26.” It further justified the adoption of the new ordinance by noting the practice of tobacco companies to “capitalize on the vulnerability of our youth, minorities, lower income residents, and young adults to promote their products.” The ban will not apply to retailers like Safeway or Wal-Mart that sell tobacco or smokeless products as part of a much larger product mix. Tuesday’s decision was the first of two votes on the ordinance. The council intends to bring the matter back at its next meeting and vote on it again, presumably with the same unanimous outcome.

Blog: World No Tobacco Day: Here's why vaping is as harmful as smoking cigarettes 
.W 
Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) is a collective term used to house the new electronically driven vapes, most commonly available over-the-counter, online, and sheepishly marketed E-Cigarettes. How often have you been told that e-cigarettes are a healthy alternative to conventional cigarettes? How often have they caused you an urge to take up a stick which is as easily available as the smartphone you own? Haven’t you heard of misinformed healthcare practitioners also falsely claiming that e-cigarettes are an easy alternative to cigarette smoking? What are e-cigarettes? They are electronic devices that replicate cigarettes, cigar and smoking pipes. They mimic the original in looks, tastes and feel; and expel colourless aerosols that look like smoke but are not. The hype behind its popularity got “vaping” -- or the process of smoking e-cigarettes -- the honour of being chosen as the International Word of the year 2014 by Oxford Dictionary. US agencies report about 900 per cent growth in the use of e-cigarettes in recent years. Also, vaping competitions have given teens a major thrust and chance to be perceived as being “cool” in society. Ironically, these websites allow teens to register themselves by the age of 13 years even though these e-cigarettes cannot be sold to anyone below the age of 18 years. The exponential rise in the use of e-cigarettes can be attributed to its sleek design. The electronic equipment can be recharged, is customisable and is available in a plethora of flavours and additives. Without an iota of doubt, this device is a perfect fit for teens who are impulsive and have a drive to try new things. This stick provides them with a perfect blend of technology which can be customised and innovative. E-cigarettes can contain nicotine or can be nicotine free. Both these have their share of severe, potent and long-lasting negative effects. Introduced as an alternative to cigarettes and to combat cigarette addiction, these devices were meant to offer nicotine-free smoke but as mentioned it can be customised with any additives, be it nicotine, alcohol or any synthetic flavours with the concentration they want. Technically speaking, they are nothing but a fancy assembly of a cartridge, a heating coil/ chip, lithium ion battery and volatile liquid. The battery can be plugged in any USB port for charging. All this can be tactfully done to make it look just like a cigarette, yet promoting it as an easy alternative to quit the cigarette smoking addiction. Contrary to popular belief, the smoke produced is not water vapour; those are aerosols which are suspended in air for long hours. The additives added to the liquid in form of flavours and colours can have heavy metal ions which are known to cause irreversible organ damage. Apart from physiological effects, the psychological dependence seen with these products is highly pronounced as they are not depicted as a threat as compared to contemporary cigarettes even when they are known to contain nicotine. Nicotine, apart from causing psychological dependence, is known to bind with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors throughout the body. Chronic exposure may lead to loss of elasticity of blood vessels, narrowing of air spaces in lungs, loss of flexibility of heart muscles and so on. Animal studies already have shown nicotine to be brain damaging and causing irreversible damage in areas of comprehension i.e learning and memory, producing hyper-reactivate humans. Mentioning some technicalities- the e-cigarettes have nicotine, propylene glycol and glycerine. The FDA has issued blaring warning signs regarding the harmful effects of the TSNAs (Tobacco Specific Nitrosamines) and DEGs (Di-Ethylene Glycols) it emits. Also, it is a very well-established fact that teens exposed to nicotine or any form of physical or psychological addiction are more prone to end up doing drugs and alcohol. Synergetic effect of these things are not only seen with their own generation but may also lead to gene defect which can be seen in their offsprings. Following suit, on recommendations from the top portals of the Govt. of India, the Ministry of Health and family Welfare, Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS), Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO), 12 states in India, including Maharashtra, have banned these ‘new emerging threats’- ending the ENDS. India being the second most populous country in the world is home to a significant ‘demogarphic dividend’ of population younger than 25 years old. It is fundamental duty of every individual to dethrone what doesn’t serve the purpose and enlighten every individual of its effects. Collectively we aren’t only looking at the dangers of tobacco related products but also the newer versions which are catching the attention of a lot of today's youth. A difficulty well foreseen and worked upon will help to reduce the number of youths falling into the trap of societal and peer pressures to look and be “cool”. Lets avenge this ENDS game – and kick butt of the mistaken identity of these fab fads! Dr Vaibhav Kumar is Faculty, Department of Public Health Dentistry, Terna Dental College.

Illegal sale of imported cigarettes on rise in Punjab  Indian News in Tampa Bay Area 
.W 
Punjab,National,Crime/Disaster/Accident Chandigarh, Sep 19 (IANS) Illegal sale of imported cigarettes in Punjab has become common and pose a serious threat to health of smokers who are getting hooked to catchy packs of international brands that san health warnings, anti-tobacco activists said on Thursday. They say selling illegal cigarettes, an organised crime, is not only evading state's high taxes but also playing with the lives of smokers, mainly the first-timers, because of inferior manufacturing processes and low quality tobacco with high levels of tar and nicotine. Trade insiders told IANS that Punjab alone has an annual legal market of 120 million cigarettes and the illegal market accounts for 20 per cent of the total trade. Chandigarh and Panchkula cities have a market of 30 million and six million cigarettes annually and the illegal market also has a share of 15-20 per cent. Most of the illegal cigarette brands originate from China and Indonesia and the retailers are attracting to them as they are available at a significantly lower price than the legal cigarettes. They are sold in the market at one fifth the price of legal product. "The trade of illegal brands is getting acute in big cities like Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Patiala and Amritsar where the retailers prefer to sell these brands that are cheap in the market and the profit margin is enormous," said an insider. He said there is a huge price difference between Indian brand of cigarettes and the illegal one due to evasion of tax. Take the case of an imported brand. A pack of 20 cigarettes costs Rs 20-30 to a retailer, who is selling at a cost of Rs 100. While an Indian brand cost between Rs 250 and Rs 300 with a profit margin of approximately Rs 5. "We have submitted a list of outlets selling illegal cigarettes across Punjab but local authorities are not taking action. In fact, the shops or kiosks outside the Deputy Commissioner's offices in Ludhiana and Jalandhar are indulging in this clandestine trade," a member of the Tobacco Institute of India (TII) here told IANS. The TII is a representative body of farmers, manufacturers and exporters in the country. These imported brands not adhere to Indian law and regulations. It has submitted its representation to the Punjab Director General of Police many a time, seeking action against retailers selling illegal tobacco products. At a media workshop here this month, experts warned of an impending crisis with implications for health and government revenues in wake of unfettered growth in manufacture and sales of illicit cigarettes in Punjab and Haryana. R.K. Tiwari of the Centre for Public Awareness said due to low surveillance and lack of regulations, manufacturers are using Punjab and Haryana as dumping ground of illicit cigarettes. Punjab Government spokesperson said the state has initiated a state-wide crusade to curb use of tobacco and habit-making products to save the youth under 'Mission Tandarust Punjab'. He said the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act (COTPA) of 2003 has been strictly implemented. It is being monitored at state level by Additional Chief Secretary Health and Family Welfare and at district by the Deputy Commissioners. A bill was passed by the legislative assembly in March last year to permanently ban hookah and hookah bars in the state. tampabayIndian.com is operated under IndianLoop.com network (Broadlink, LLC site) and is a Trademark of BroadLink, LLC.

Vaping-linked deaths prompt US ban on flavoured e-cigs  Indian News in Portland Area 
.W 
United States,Health/Medicine Washington, Sep 12 (IANS) The Trump administration said that it plans to bar the sale of non-tobacco-flavoured e-cigarettes in the United States following six deaths linked to vaping. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is in the process of drafting new regulations to remove flavored e-cigarettes from the market, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told journalists at the White House on Wednesday, Efe news reported. Once the rules are published, the industry and vendors will have 30 days to comply, the secretary said during a meeting in the Oval Office with President Donald Trump and the acting commissioner of the FDA, Ned Sharpless. "We can't allow people to get sick and we can't have our youth be so affected," Trump said. "People are dying from vaping, so we're looking at it very closely." First lady Melania Trump spoke out about the dangers of vaping earlier this week. "That's how the first lady got involved. She's got a son, together, that is a beautiful young man and she feels very, very strongly about it," the president said, referring to the Trumps' 13-year-old son, Barron. "She's seen it. We're both reading it, a lot of people are reading it. But people are dying with vaping so we're looking at it very, very closely," the president said. The FDA has yet to regulate e-cigarettes and has regarded the tobacco-flavoured versions as useful in helping adult smokers move away from conventional cigarettes. The move announced by Azar will entail a provisional ban on all sales of flavoured e-cigarettes, though the devices could return to the market if they secure FDA approval. "Kids are getting access to these products despite our best efforts at enforcement," Azar said. "They've been going at it so we simply have to remove these attractive flavoured products from the marketplace until they've secured FDA approval if they can." At least six deaths are blamed on respiratory illnesses related to vaping and health authorities have documented a total of 450 cases involving e-cigarettes, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which has issued a health warning against vaping. Last week, Michigan became the first state to issue an order aimed at ending the sale of all non-tobacco-flavoured e-cigarettes within its borders. Citing a CDC survey of teenagers, the Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement that more than 25 per cent of high school students used e-cigarettes within the last month. The "overwhelming majority" of those users said that they vaped fruit and menthol or mint flavours. Azar said Wednesday that his department will be alert to any increase in use of tobacco flavoured e-cigarettes by minors. "If we find that children start surging into tobacco flavoured e-cigarettes or if we find marketing practices that target children and try to attract them into tobacco flavoured e-cigarettes, we will engage in enforcement actions there also," the secretary said.

E-cigarettes: Help flick the switch 
.W 
Like Brexit and Trump, electronic cigarettes (e-cigs) and other vaping devices take their place among some of the most hotly debated subjects of 2016.     In fact, the growing category - which is now thought to be worth £450m in the UK, according to Blu, and used by an estimated 2.8 million people (predominantly former and current smokers) - has rarely been out of the news this year, as health experts, legislators and retailers dispute vaping’s pros, cons and future developments.    The category hit the headlines a number of times in September alone, with the British Heart Foundation questioning the impact of nicotine-containing e-cigs on vapers’ heart health, followed just a few days later by a new report published in the British Medical Journal which claimed that increased e-cig usage was helping conventional smokers to quit more successfully.    Vaping products themselves are becoming increasingly visible as convenience stores, newsagents and other grocery retailers move away from cluttered and confusing counter-top units towards high-impact back wall and standalone shop floor displays.     And with tobacco products now hidden from view and new European Tobacco Product Directive (EUTPD) laws already fuelling a dramatic reduction in the number of tobacco SKUs, the prominence of e-cigs in convenience stores looks set to increase in the months ahead.     Companies such as Real Trading, which provides convenience stores with bespoke, lit displays containing room for several leading brands and associated hardware, are enjoying booming business, while JTI is currently rolling out a new gantry solution that puts e-cigs, and its Logic Pro tank system, firmly in the spotlight.     Arjan Mehr of Londis Great Hollands in Bracknell, Berkshire, is just one retailer already tasting success with the new JTI unit, which allows tobacco products to be kept hidden behind doors on one side, while the other is left open to display e-cigs.    “This solution is a great way to merchandise e-cigs,” he says. “I think it’s important to site e-cigs and tobacco together on the back wall. JTI’s approach creates space which will allow me to showcase a wide range, which is critical in driving footfall.”    Dee Sedani of One Stop Matlock, Derbyshire, is another: “The new-look unit is working really well. I’m able to draw attention to the growing e-cig opportunity with a dedicated space, while also managing the category responsibly,” he says.    In Cobham, Surrey, another retailer who extols the virtues of a high-impact standalone vaping display is David Worlsfold of Farrants.     “Visibility is without a doubt one of the most important factors in driving sales of vaping products,” he says.    “We have a striking standalone unit, designed and built by premium vaping brand Liberty Flights, positioned on the shop floor, but immediately next to the counter and main tills. The large black unit allows products to really stand out and we stock a wide range of kits, cartomizers and liquids in all manner of flavours and nicotine strengths to give new and existing vapers a vast range of options.     “The fact that the unit is on the shop floor allows existing vapers and new converts to browse the full range unrestricted, yet counter staff are immediately on hand should they require advice.     “Our approach is clearly working as we sell upwards of £2,000-worth of vaping products a month, and that figure is growing.     “I’m a strong believer that if you decide to take on a new category you should own it and that’s what we are doing with vaping products.”    The vaping category also lends itself perfectly to impactful promotions.    Jennifer Roberts, UK category controller at Blu, says that multi-buy activities on liquids - such as ‘two for £8’, for example - are a great way to boost interest and sales. “Clearomisers are also a great way to drive additional sales and margin as consumers should change these units every few weeks,” she says.    “Ensure you stock the clearomisers for the tank brands you stock and remind your customers to buy them every time you sell a bottle of liquid,” she concludes.    Scott Rothwell, owner of Eaves Lane Londis, Chorley, Lancashire, is certainly reaping the rewards a well-managed and promoted e-cig range can bring, selling almost £1,000-worth of vaping products a week.     His vast range of e-liquids is a big draw for local vapers, and the bottles, which he buys in for between £3.24 and £4.25, sell for £10 each, or as part of a popular ‘three for £25’ deal.     However, keen to maintain momentum, Scott has been focusing heavily on promotion and ways of driving repeat purchase, developing a loyalty card scheme in the process.    Cardholders who buy into the store’s ‘three for £25’ e-liquid deal nine times get their 10th purchase for half-price at £12.50.    And as with any rapidly-developing category, but particularly one which is subject to so much new legislation and debate, education is key.    “Vaping is a journey and we strive to support our customers on it at every step,” David adds. “Tobacco smokers looking to switch to vaping are always a bit recalcitrant at first, it’s as though they almost want the experience to fail. That’s why it’s so important to really understand the category so you can recommend the correct products for their needs.     “It’s important that new vapers understand that it’s not a silver bullet to give up smoking, more of a bronze one, and there might be a little trial and error at first.     “That’s why choice is key. Vaping is an investment and new vapers don’t want to see just one car in the showroom, they want to see a range of options. Inevitably, though, once we’ve taken them through all their options, first-timers tend to buy the same sort of product: our entry-level kit which includes a tank, rechargeable battery and a liquid for £19. Taking the time to talk them through their options and getting them on the right sort of product that includes the right level of nicotine content is well worth it, as when it works, new vapers become almost evangelical about it and you benefit from strong loyalty,” he adds.     So how is the market developing? According to a new report produced by Ernst & Young (E&Y) for BAT-owned Nicoventures, 4% of the UK population now vapes and the number of UK vapers has almost doubled over the past two years, fuelled by “the perception of relative health benefits compared with combustible cigarettes”.    As most vapers are either current or ex-smokers, the lower price of e-cigs when compared with combustible tobacco products was found to be a factor, but not a driving one.    The UK market can be broadly divided into three key categories, according to the report. These are: disposable products - which can be discarded when the pre-filled cartridge of e-liquid is empty; rechargeable products - which are designed to be refilled by the user.; and modular products - which can also be refilled by the user, but also allow users to regulate the power delivered from the batteries to the atomizer.    Modular devices have overtaken rechargeable as the most commonly-used type of device by UK vapers. Modulars are now chosen by 59% of UK vapers compared with 39% of users who use rechargeable e-cigs. The least popular devices are disposables, which now account for just 16% of sales.     As the vaping category becomes better established, regulated and trusted, these pricier, more complex modular devices are growing increasingly popular with first-time vapers. In fact, according to E&Y, 27% of new UK vapers now start off using a modular device. Just over 30% use a disposable product, while most (41%) take their first puffs on a rechargeable product.     Liquid lines    Understandably, the booming sales of modular products are driving an associated increase in sales of e-liquids. Jennifer Roberts, UK category controller at Blu, elaborates: “We’re seeing more and more consumers entering the category going straight into the ‘open’ liquid systems (tank kits and e-liquids), with more than 40% of value share in the market coming from e-liquids and e-liquid systems.”     She adds: “E-liquid formats remain the fastest-growing area of e-cigs in the UK, growing at 102% year on year due to the value savings, greater flavour range and the increased product performance they offer (Nielsen scantrack 52 weeks to 13 August 2016).    “To offer consumers a real choice we recommend retailers stock a range of flavours and strengths to suit different needs.”    According to the latest JTI insight, the three most popular vaping flavours are menthol (37%), followed by fruit (30%), then tobacco (29%).    Nicotine    Just as with flavours, UK vapers can choose from a wide range of nicotine strengths, including 0% nicotine, which is growing in popularity.     In the UK, 65% of vapers’ most commonly-used devices contain between 1 and 11mg of nicotine, according to E&Y. Just under 20% of devices currently smoked contain 12 to 18mg of nicotine, while 13% are nicotine-free. Only 5% of consumption is accounted for by nicotine strengths of 18mg plus - good news considering the EUTPD will ban the production of e-liquids containing more than 20mg/ml in November.     It’s vital that retailers have a wide range, and firm understanding, of the different nicotine strengths that they offer, says e-cig brand Vaporized. Allowing a new vaper to buy the wrong one can lead to a negative experience and potentially hamper future sales.     With most vapers using e-cigs as a way to cut down or stop smoking tobacco, Vaporized suggests that retailers always ask new and existing vapers about their tobacco smoking habits. Questions such as how many cigarettes do they, or did they, smoke a day and which brand can help retailers work out the correct nicotine strength for them.    As a rough guide:     6mg/0.6% (low) - up to 10 cigarettes a day     12mg/1.2% (medium) - up to 20 cigarettes a day     18mg/1.8% (high) - up to 30 cigarettes a day    David Worlsfold recommends that existing smokers switching to vaping use a 1.8% nicotine strength e-liquid at first “so that they get a similar sort of nicotine hit to tobacco”.    “We then find that within a few months the level naturally reduces to 1.2% and we are now seeing growth of nicotine-free e-liquids,” he says.     Legal lowdown    EUTPD laws also apply to cigarettes and rolling tobacco. Liquid refill bottles cannot contain more than 10ml of liquid and products cannot contain more than 20mg/ml of nicotine. Packaging will need to contain health warnings and correct labelling, be tamper resistant and child proof, and products must also be registered with the Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency.     According to Blu, suppliers and manufacturers are “busy putting their plans in place for being compliant.”     “There are significant costs involved in this, so many brands are expected to drop out of the market,” Blu’s Roberts adds.     Danny Sohota, of specialist vaping distributor Real Trading, agrees. “There are more than 900 brands on the market, with this estimated to reduce by at least 50% when EUTPD kicks in,” he says.  Phase 1: Advertising and promotion restrictions came into effect, restricting TV, radio, consumer press and social media advertising Retailer action: Increase visibility and POS in-store to drive awareness and sales Retailer action: Understand what compliant products look like and start to promote existing stock to sell-through Phase 3: The sale of non-compliant stock is no longer allowed Retailer action: It is now retailers’ responsibility to stock and sell fully-compliant products. Blu recommends buying only compliant stock post-January 2017 to give retailers time to sell through old stock.  E-liquids: Mind your Ps and Vs E-liquids can contain a mix of two, or sometimes three, key ‘diluents’ alongside flavour and maybe nicotine. These diluents are known as PG, VG, and sometimes AG, and each boasts a particular set of attributes to suit different vaping needs. PG stands for propylene glycol. It’s a thin, clear, odourless liquid which has long been used as a preservative and flavour carrier in food products, and is well-liked for its ability to carry, and even enhance, e-liquid flavours and deliver a “strong throat hit”. VG stands for vegetable glycerine. The thick and naturally sweet liquid is made from vegetable oil and is also commonly used in food products, cosmetics and toothpaste as a sweetener. VG-based e-liquids deliver a smooth vaping experience, without the same strong throat hit as PG. They are also renowned for their ability to create large vape clouds, but due to the liquid’s thickness VGs can require more power to vape. AG stands for aqueous glycerine. This is a VG diluent with the addition of de-ionised water to thin the mixture. Many e-liquids contain a combination of PG and VG to help vapers achieve a good ratio of vapour, flavour, and ‘throat hit’, so it’s well worth noting the mix included in the products for sale in your store.

Myanmar’s Weak Legislation a “Lucky Strike” for Foreign Tobacco Giants 
.W 
For international tobacco companies struggling in their home markets with low sales due to an increasing awareness about the dangers of smoking, Myanmar is an exciting business opportunity.  In July, British American Tobacco, the world’s second largest cigarette manufacturer, signed a $50 million investment deal to produce, market, and sell its brand in Myanmar over the next five years, according to AP. The company plans to construct a factory on the outskirts of Yangon. The year before, Japan Tobacco entered into a partnership with local tycoon, Kyaw Win, and is building a factory. Even China’s largest tobacco producer is planning a multi-million-dollar joint venture.  Between one-third and half of Myanmar’s 60 million people consume tobacco in some form, mostly through chewing it in betel leaves or smoking cheroots, according to Aljazeera. Although only five percent of the smoking population uses filtered cigarettes, that number is expected to rise with the emergence of a large middle class with more disposable income.  Even after years of isolation, young people in this country want to be as “cool” as those in the West. Shisha usage is now hip among Yangon youth, especially females.  “We have to go out to a restaurant or bar to smoke, and it’s fashionable,” said Ko Aung Zin Latt, 28.  “I wanted to imitate the people I saw in movies. It seemed cool then,” said Kyaw Zin Lin, a 42-year-old who began smoking at 12.  The country has a widespread tradition of smoking. Children often help their fathers light cheroots and it’s common to see boys as young as 12 buy cigarettes from street vendors. Most citizens don’t even know how bad tobacco is for their health.  “I heard that smoking can be harmful, but not everyone who smokes gets cancer,” said Khin Cho, a 37-year-old housewife. “I am OK now, and I don’t want to worry about something that hasn’t happened yet.”  Although the country ratified the WHO Framework Convention against Tobacco Control in 2004, Myanmar has failed to implement some of its guidelines – such as putting health warnings on cigarette packaging. That along with insufficient and poorly enforced legislation for the tobacco industry makes Myanmar vulnerable to companies seeking profit. Under current regulations, tobacco companies can even promote themselves under the guise of offering scholarships to children or sponsoring community projects.  “Many countries don’t have trade lawyers, financial people to challenge [these multinational corporations],” said Judith Mackay, a senior adviser to the World Lung Foundation. “In 10 years Myanmar will get up to speed [with its legislation enforcement], but right now it is very vulnerable.”

Ombudsman report a smoking gun on lax tobacco control 
.W 
Updated: 2018-02-26 06:37 By Judith Mackay(HK Edition) Judith Mackay recommends authorities seize the opportunity to enforce legislation against lighting up in bars and restaurants, which after all are workplaces The Ombudsman's Report launched early this month is critical of the government in nine different areas for inadequately enforcing Hong Kong's existing smoke-free laws. As in many countries and regions, the greatest non-compliance is in restaurants and bars, particularly as in Hong Kong there is currently no legal onus for licensees to comply. This is in stark contrast to almost every other jurisdiction, including Singapore and Chinese mainland cities. The reason for this goes back to the inadequacy of the 2007 smoke-free law, which penalizes only the smoker, but not the owners or managers of restaurants and bars, saunas, mahjong and tin kau premises. Even back in 2007, this was out of line with global wisdom, experience and trends. So why did Hong Kong do this? It is common knowledge this was due to pressure from a certain political party - that they would support the 2007 law only if managers were not held responsible. Pressure on the government also came from the Entertainment Business Rights Concern Group, which indicated that such establishments "face a crushing blow, with an estimate of 2,600 entertainment establishments facing a crisis of closure of business, and the 'rice bowls' of some 100,000 employees are in jeopardy". All of which, of course, proved to be complete nonsense - the opposite happened, restaurant tax returns increased 31 percent in the two years following the ban. This has led to the current situation in Hong Kong where some managers even collude with smoking patrons, warning them to "stub out" and hide ashtrays when Tobacco Control officers are seen approaching. And, to compound the problem, the Ombudsman found night-time enforcement was particularly lacking at the most relevant time for the offences to occur, with less than two raids per evening shift throughout the year 2016. The current administration inherited this deeply flawed law, but hitherto has neither attempted to amend Hong Kong's tobacco law via the Legislative Council (a daunting task nowadays) nor turned to simple solutions such as enforcing the Conditions to the Liquor Licensing Board by fining licensees where tobacco is consumed on their premises or, for repeat offenders, closing the premises. In theory, this should not even require any amendment to the liquor licensing law which currently stipulates that: "The licensee shall not permit any person to occupy or use any portion of the premises for any immoral or illegal purpose." This clearly includes the illegal act of smoking in legally designated smoke-free areas but many licensees have failed to uphold the law. Two of the Ombudsman's 11 recommendations relate to this problem, stating that the government should review licensing conditions, and "impose criminal liabilities on those venue managers who acquiesce to or condone illegal smoking on their premises". If this is done, then many of the other recommendations would become less necessary as enforcement agents would effectively grow by 8,075 (the number of bar licensees) at no extra cost to the government! Licensees are already obliged to prevent drunkenness, disorder and prostitution in their premises, none of which kill people in remotely the numbers which second-hand tobacco smoke does. If this is not done, there will be endless and expensive escalation of the number of Tobacco Control officers. This is labor legislation. Patrons are in restaurants and bars for a relatively short time compared with workers in these establishments. Given the proven harm of tobacco smoke on non-smokers, it is disgraceful that some employers have such disregard for their employees that they continue to thwart the law, and expose their own staff to known cancer-producing chemicals. I have been privileged to work closely with authorities on the mainland on national and city smoke-free legislation, particularly in Shenzhen, Beijing and Shanghai. At every opportunity, I impressed on these cities not to adopt Hong Kong's legislation but to fine managers as well as smokers. This advice was taken, and these cities' legislation is now much better than Hong Kong's. In Hong Kong, this report is an opportunity for the government to grasp this political nettle once and for all, and do two things: first, immediately amend/enforce the liquor licensing conditions and second and simultaneously start the process to amend the legislation. The government has a duty of care to protect people's health. Second-hand smoke kills. It has been proven far too many times! The government knows the deadly consequence of further delays!

FDA orders 4 cigarette brands pulled from the market - Minnesota Public Radio News 
.W 
For the first time, the Food and Drug Administration has ordered a major tobacco company to stop selling brands of cigarettes.  The FDA on Tuesday ordered the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company to stop selling for brands: Camel Bold Crush, Vantage Tech 13 and the regular and menthol versions of Pall Mall Deep Set Recessed Filter cigarettes.  The FDA has ordered other cigarettes off the market before, but those actions involved much smaller companies selling much less popular cigarettes.  The agency says it took the action because R.J. Reynolds had failed to prove the brands were no more dangerous than brands that have been on the market longer.  "These decisions were based on a rigorous, science-based review designed to protect the public from the harms caused by tobacco use," Mitch Zeller, director of the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products, said in a statement. "The agency will continue to review product submissions and exercise it's legal authority and consumer protection duty to remove products from the market when they fail to meet the public health bar set forth under law."  Congress gave the FDA authority to regulate cigarettes for the first time in 2009. Among the agency's new powers are the authority to require new brands to prove they pose no more risks to smokers than cigarettes that were put on the market before Feb. 15, 2007.  The FDA says R.J. Reynolds had failed to show the four brands that have been ordered off the market do not expose smokers to more harmful chemicals, higher levels of menthol or new ingredients.

Juul and the vape debate: Choosing between smokers and teens 
.W 
The year was 2004, and James Monsees and Adam Bowen couldn't stop taking smoking breaks during a brainstorming session for their joint master's thesis at Stanford University's design school. It was during one of these breaks that they decided: Why not create a better way to deliver nicotine? Eleven years later, they unveiled Juul, a device that gives users a flavored nicotine fix without the smell and smoke of combustible cigarettes. It's an e-cigarette, which means it doesn't burn tobacco but rather generates an aerosol by heating a liquid that contains nicotine. Juul, along with many other e-cigarette products, has found a place in a multibillion-dollar market. According to a Bloomberg report from late June, Juul controls 68% of the e-cigarette market. In 2016, 3.2% of US adults were current e-cigarette smokers while 15.5% smoked combustible cigarettes according to the National Health Interview Survey. Younger adults were more likely to vape than older ones. Today, Monsees and Bowen are the chief product officers for the company. Ashley Gould, the chief administrative officer for Juul Labs, said they designed Juul for adult smokers trying to switch from combustible cigarettes, but data show the product's startling popularity among youth. "It's been devastating to us," Gould said. "This is not a product for youth. It's a product for adult smokers." According to a 2017 national online survey by the Truth Initiative, a nonprofit tobacco control organization, 7% of teens 15 to 17 reported having ever used a Juul. "The evidence is overwhelming today that these products appeal to kids," said Matt Myers, president of the nonprofit organization Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. But Juul Labs argues that, by helping people give up cigarettes completely, the company provides a potentially life-saving service to current smokers, two-thirds of whom will die from smoking-related illnesses. The scientific consensus, however, is still out on the long-term health effects of vaping. And new research, combined with lawsuits against Juul Labs, threatens to undermine the company's argument. "We need to talk to our kids, and at the same time, we can't forget about the 38 million American adult smokers in our country who need and deserve our support," Gould said. New research on the health effects of vaping and lawsuits against Juul Labs threaten to undermine the company's argument. Juul gone viral At Jonathan Law High School in Milford, Connecticut, Principal Francis Thompson pulled from his pocket a sleek device resembling a USB drive. It's the Juul, the most popular vape students used, he said. Vaping among teens took off so rapidly at Jonathan Law, the school had to take drastic measures. "Being a relatively new phenomenon, we didn't know a lot about vaping and its impact and its danger and, quite frankly, its popularity that continues to rise among teenagers," Thompson said. "It was causing several issues in our school bathrooms." Thompson closed all but one of the school's bathrooms. But then, kids began to brazenly vape in hallways and classrooms instead, recalls Andrew Paulus, an 18-year-old recent graduate. "It was a party setting. I saw everyone was doing it, so I was like, 'Let me just try it once just to see what this fuss is about,' " Paulus said. Emma Hudd, one of Paulus' classmates, said that teachers who didn't know any better would allow kids to plug their vapes into classroom computers to charge them. Hudd, 18, likened Juul to her generation's version of cigarettes. "We need to understand this more, because no usage of our product by youth is acceptable to us," Gould said. "I can tell you certainly though, it was not designed to look like a USB device. It was not designed to be hid by kids," she said. "This is a product that was designed by smokers for adult smokers, and that is the design ethos of the product." Bella Kacoyannakis saw the Juul on social media sites, where people would post about how "awesome" it was, she said. The first time the 20-year-old tried it, she said she was immediately drawn to its small size, simple upkeep and fruity flavors. "I like the Juul better than cigarettes because the taste is so much more pleasant. And, like, the nicotine content isn't really that much different," Kacoyannakis said. The nicotine in one Juulpod, a small disposable e-liquid cartridge that's inserted into the vaping device, is equal to that of an entire pack of cigarettes, according to the company. The rate at which a Juulpod is consumed varies among users, but can last about 200 puffs. Since Kacoyannakis switched from cigarettes to the Juul, she says, she vapes more than she used to smoke because of how convenient the device is. Gould said the company's data do not show that Juulers who switched from cigarettes are taking in more nicotine than they did when they smoked. Independent research hasn't yet confirmed Juul Labs' data. Kacoyannakis recently picked up the box of her Juul and for the first time read the warning label. "This product contains chemicals known to the state of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm," she read aloud. She had never noticed the California Proposition 65 warning before. Neither had Paulus or his friends. "On the front [of the packaging], it's big letters, J-U-U-L Juul, or it has the flavoring in the color of the pod, but no one really looks at the side to see this really small writing saying, 'Oh, caution, this is bad for you or whatever,' " he said. The Truth Initiative survey reported that 63% of young Juul users did not know that the product always contains nicotine. Gould said Juul Labs has added larger warning labels that now announce that the product contains nicotine across 20% of the space showing on a package. What's in the vape? Nicotine isn't the only ingredient in e-cigarettes, though. Studies from Harvard and Johns Hopkins researchers found that e-cigarette users wind up inhaling dangerous chemicals and toxic heavy metals along with their nicotine fix. "There's a lot that's happening with an e-cigarette besides just the nicotine and the carrier fluid. You're also inhaling these flavoring chemicals like diacetyl or cousins of diacetyl, which have been found to be harmful," said Joe Allen, an assistant professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the first author of a study on the presence of diacetyl in e-cigarettes. Much of what's known about diacetyl's effects on the lungs comes from studying the workers in a microwave popcorn packaging plant, Allen said. Twenty years ago, these workers developed a disease called bronchiolitis obliterans, or popcorn lung, after inhaling the fumes of artificial butter flavoring from open vats in their workplace. "You see a slow onset of some symptoms like wheezing, shortness of breath or coughing," Allen said. "This is a disease that is irreversible, often requiring a lung transplant." But David Abrams, a professor at the NYU College of Global Public Health who has researched smoking cessation for 40 years, doesn't see diacetyl inhalation as much of a threat for vapers. "I think this whole story of diacetyl and popcorn lung, which is true only in popcorn workers who were exposed for eight to 10 hours a day has been completely exaggerated, and it's part of what's led the public into thinking e-cigarettes are as dangerous as cigarettes," he said. Nevertheless, Abrams said the public can't be reassured completely until the US Food and Drug Administration regulates vaping products. The future of regulation Last year, the FDA announced that it would delay regulations that could have halted the sales of many e-cigarettes. Instead, the agency gave extensions to new and existing vaping products, giving them until August 2022 to submit information to support their products' safety and efficacy as switching devices. The organization decided on this timeline to "make certain that the FDA is striking an appropriate balance between regulation and encouraging development of innovative tobacco products that may be less dangerous than cigarettes," according to the news release announcing the extensions. Michael Felberbaum, an FDA spokesman, said the agency does not have any additional information regarding a regulatory timeline once these applications are submitted. Meanwhile, the agency plans to propose a series of product standards to address some of the known public health risks of these products, which includes taking a close look at flavors, he said. Greg Conley, president of the American Vaping Association, said the question facing the American public and the FDA is not whether there should be regulations but whether they should be so strict as to wipe out competition from independent vape companies. "Reasonable product standards that actually help make the products better, help instill consumer confidence, that would be fine," he said. "But what the FDA has proposed is not regulation; it is prohibition for 99% of products on the market today." Gould says reasonable regulation would entail banning candy flavoring for e-cigs like cotton candy and gummy bear, cracking down on marketing to youth and restricting purchase to buyers 21 and older. Protecting kids Even as it announced the extensions last year, FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said the agency would "redouble our efforts to protect kids from all nicotine-containing products." Felberbaum said the agency's goal is to balance public health concerns alongside the innovation of the e-cigarette industry, which "can't come at the expense of kids," he added. In April, after telling CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta that the organization would be taking enforcement actions "very soon" against companies believed to be marketing products to young people, Gottlieb announced a "blitz" on retailers for violations related to sales of e-cigarettes to minors. The agency said it sent Juul Labs a request to submit documents related to product marketing and research, including information about "youth initiation and use." In July, the company was hit with multiple lawsuits that allege Juul Labs intentionally targets teens in its marketing. Prior to the lawsuits, Gould said the company took seriously the criticism of its 2015 launch campaign, which used young-looking models. The company had also announced that it would no longer use models on social media platforms, instead focusing on testimonials from adult smokers who switched to Juul. "That campaign in the end, we felt, did not help us achieve our mission of speaking to adult smokers to provide them information about an alternative to cigarettes," she said. Juul uses age verification measures on its website, but Gould said 90% of the company's sales are at the retail level, which is more difficult to regulate. Paulus, the recent high school graduate, says enforcing stricter age laws won't stop underage users from getting their hands on Juuls. "I'm 18, and a freshman, sophomore, junior -- if they really want to smoke or use a Juul, they could ask me or ask anyone in the senior class that's over 18, and they could easily just give them money, go to a store, pick it up for them," he said. Other approaches target the schools where the Juuling problem is prevalent. One independent organization that has developed an e-cigarette prevention program for middle and high school students is the Coordinated Approach to Child Health, or CATCH. It includes four lessons with topics that include e-cigarette ingredients, marketing techniques and skills for refusing e-cigarettes. Ashley Monteiro, a student at Wareham Middle School in Massachusetts, said that before taking the class, she thought e-cigarettes looked "pretty cool" and the flavors might taste good. But since learning about the use of artificial flavorings and chemicals in vapes, she's no longer interested. For Hudd, a 2018 grad of Jonathan Law High School, the solution to the vaping craze is to escape its epicenter. "I'm happy I'm leaving high school so that I can get out of here and away from all the Juuling," she said.

Singapore to become first country to ban ads for sugary drinks 
.W 
World SINGAPORE: Singapore will become the first country in the world to ban ads for the most unhealthy sugary drinks in its latest move to combat rising diabetes rates, the health ministry said on Thursday. Products deemed "less healthy" must now display labels grading their nutritional and sugar content, with those considered to be most unhealthy banned from appearing in ads across all media platforms, including broadcast, print and online channels. "This aims to reduce the influence of such advertisements on consumer preferences," the ministry said, calling the ban a world-first. It added that the measures were only a start and it will continue to explore the possibility of a sugar tax or ban. "We urge SSB (sugar-sweetened beverages) manufacturers to consider reformulating their drinks to contain less sugar even as we further study these measures," it said. The ministry said it will obtain industry feedback in the coming months on how to implement the measures and announce more details next year. According to the International Diabetes Federation, 13.7 percent of adults suffer from diabetes in Singapore, one of the highest rates among developed nations. Other marketing bans around the world have focused on restricting children’s exposure to junk food ads.

AP WAS THERE: '64 US report ties smoking to cancer 
.W 
WASHINGTON (AP) — EDITOR'S NOTE — On Jan. 11, 1964, AP Science Writer Frank Carey covered the release of U.S. Surgeon General Luther Terry's historic report linking cigarette smoking to lung cancer. The report has been called one of the most important documents in U.S. public health history. While not the first to raise the alarm about smoking, it gave momentum to the push for tobacco controls. The surgeon general has periodically issued more smoking reports, and a new one is due out next week. Fifty years after its original publication, the AP is making this story available to its subscribers.  WASHINGTON (AP) — Heavy cigarette smoking is the principal cause of cancer of the lungs and the larynx and a health hazard so grave as to call for remedial action, a blue-ribbon science panel concluded today.  The nature of that action was not spelled out. However, Surgeon General Luther Terry of the U.S. Public Health Service said his agency will move promptly to recommend specific steps of the kind urged by the science group. Meanwhile, he told a news conference: "I would advise anyone to discontinue smoking cigarettes."  The 10-man special advisory committee on smoking and health took 14 months to evaluate more than 8,000 studies of the effect of smoking on health.  It undertook no fresh research but decided available evidence shows that cigarette smoking far outweighs all other causes of lung cancer and cancer of the larynx — in men and perhaps in women.  It had no such clear-cut indictment of cigarette smoking in the area of heart and blood vessel disease or lesser aliments sometimes associated with smoking.  But, broadly, the panel took the view that the more you smoke the more you risk early death.  The special group was not requested to make specific recommendations for laws or regulations to offset smoking hazards but it concluded: "Cigarette smoking is a health hazard of sufficient importance in the United States to warrant appropriate remedial action."  After releasing the report, Terry declared that there will be "no footdragging" in seeking possible remedial steps.  In another major conclusion the committee of scientists said: "In view of the continuing and mounting evidence from many sources, it is the judgment of the committee that cigarette smoking contributes substantially to mortality from certain specific diseases and to the over-all death rate. "  The report, which ran to about 150,000 words and several hundred pages, hit hardest at cigarette smoking as being what it termed a significant cause of lung cancer, chronic bronchitis, and cancer of the larynx, or voice box. The committee was more reserved in linking cigarette smoking with heart disease and circulatory disorders, at least as to any cause-and-effect relationship.  The report said in this respect: "Male cigarette smokers have a higher death rate from coronary artery disease than non-smoking males, but it is not clear that the association has causal significance." But it said also that an association has been established between cigarette smoking in men and higher rates of coronary disease, and it asserted: "It is . more prudent to assume that the established association between cigarette smoking and coronary disease has a causative meaning than to suspend judgment until no uncertainty remains." As for lung cancer, the report said that in men, cigarette smoking far outweighs other possible causes of the malady and "the data for women, though less extensive, point in the same direction."  " It said the risk of developing lung cancer for pipe smokers and cigarette smokers is greater than for nonsmokers "but much less than for cigarette smokers." For various specific diseases, Terry said in a statement, the committee's findings were that cigar and pipe smoking have little significance in comparison with cigarettes.  But while it found much physical menace in smoking, the committee reported that there are benefits in the area of mental health and ease, saying "the habit originates in a search for contentment."  As regards other diseases, the box score of the report ran this way:  1. Cancer of the esophagus — there is evidence of an association with smoking, but cause and effect have not been decided on the basis of present evidence.  2. Cancer of the urinary bladder — an association with cigarette smoking but not enough evidence to establish a cause-and-effect link.  4. Peptic ulcer (including ulcers of the stomach and of the duodenum which links the stomach with the intestines)_an association with cigarette smoking but no cause and effect yet established.  5. Amblyopia, dimness of vision unexplained by any bodily defect — an apparent relationship between this ailment and pipe and cigar smoking — but no cause-and-effect link yet made.  6. Cirrhosis of the liver: — there is increased mortality from this among smokers, but the evidence is not sufficient to establish the cause and effect link.  7. Infant birth weight — women who smoke cigarettes during pregnancy tend to have babies of lower than usual birth weight. But Information is lacking on the mechanism by which this decrease in birth rate is produced.  The report said that available evidence suggests the existence of some constitutional differences between smokers and nonsmokers but it is still too meager to permit a conclusion.  As to mortality among cigarette smokers the report declared that one study has shown that the death rate for smokers of cigarettes only is about 70 percent higher than that for nonsmokers, and it added: "The death rates increase with the amount smoked."  The report said that in most parts of the nation cigarette smoking contributes to chronic lung and bronchial ailments much more than does air pollution.  Terry told newsmen who were given an hour and a half to study the report before its release that it "has provided us with the most comprehensive compilation and analysis ever undertaken on the relationship between smoking and health."  "You will have noted," Terry said, "that the committee's report does not cover what 'appropriate remedial action' might be. It was not a part of the responsibility of this committee to make such recommendations." But Terry added: "I can assure the committee that we will move promptly to determine what remedial health measures the public health service should take. Secretary (of welfare) Celebreeze has asked me to analyze the report and make recommendations to him.  "The staff of the public health service is only now receiving the report and I shall, of course, want their views before making our recommendations. I am sure that other departments and agencies of the federal government, along with non-federal agencies, will also take the report under consideration promptly."  Asked whether the committee's report could now be considered to represent the government's official thinking on the subject of smoking and health, Terry replied that it could not. But he added: "On the other hand, having had the opportunity to go over it, I can assure you it is an excellent report."  Asked when government action of any kind would be taken on the report, Terry replied: "It would be inappropriate for me to try to say when ... but in our (Public Health Service) department this matter is considered of such importance that I do not believe there will be any foot-dragging."  In saying that on the basis of the committee's findings he as a doctor would recommend against smoking, Terry said that "in the light of a clear-cut association" between smoking and lung cancer as found by the committee, he would say that If anyone continued to smoke "he should do it with a recognition that he is subjecting himself to a definite health risk."  The surgeon general said copies of the report are being sent to members of congress. "And to the heads of other federal agencies who have an interest in the findings and conclusions." He added that copies are also being mailed to the governors of the states, the state health offices, voluntary health agencies, representatives of industry and labor, and others concerned. And within the next few weeks, he said, the report will be sent to every physician and osteopath in the country.  In another of its major findings the document said: "Cigarette smoking is associated with a 70 percent increase in the age-specific death rates of males and to a lesser extent to increased death rates of females.  "The total number of excess deaths casually related to cigarette smoking in the U.S. population cannot be accurately estimated." As regards the illnesses in which it declared cigarette smoking was a particular hazard, the report put it this way:  Lung cancer — "Cigarette smoking is casually related to lung cancer in men; the magnitude of the effect of cigarette smoking far outweighs all other factors. The data for women, though less extensive, point in the same direction.  "The risk of developing lung cancer increases with duration of smoking and the number of cigarettes smoked per day, and is disminished by discontinuing smoking.  "In comparison with non-smokers, average male smokers of cigarettes have approximately a 9-to-10-fold risk of developing lung cancer and heavy smokers at least a 20-fold risk." Chronic bronchitis and pulmonary emphysema (an enlargement of the air sacs of the lungs which may make breathing difficult and possibly bring on heart failure) — "Cigarette smoking is the most important of the causes of chronic bronchitis in the United States and increases the risk of dying from chronic bronchitis and emphysema.  "A relationship exists between cigarette smoking and emphysema but it has not been established that the relationship is causal. Studies demonstrate that fatalities from this disease are infrequent among non-smokers." The committee said cigarette smoking "does not appear to cause asthma." And it added: "Although death certification shows that cigarette smokers have a moderately increased risk of death from influenza and pneumonia, an association of cigarette smoking and infectious diseases is not otherwise substantiated."  Speaking on the subject of "the tobacco habit and nicotine" the panel reported: "The habitual use of tobacco is related primarily to psychological and social drives, reinforced and perpetuated by pharmacological (drug) actions of nicotine.  "Social stimulation appears to play a major role in a young person's early and first experiments with smoking. No scientific evidence supports the popular hypothesis that smoking among adolescents is an expression of rebellion against authority."  Then the report added: "Individual stress appears to be associated more with fluctuations in the amount of smoking than with the prevalence of smoking. The overwhelming evidence indicates that smoking — its beginning, habituation, and occasional discontinuation — is to a very large extent psychologically and socially determined."  The committee said: "In general, the greater the number of cigarettes smoked daily, the higher the death rate (from all causes). "For men who smoke fewer than 10 cigarettes a day, according to the seven prospective studies, the death rate from all causes is about 40 percent higher than for non-smokers.  "For those who smoke from 10 to 19 cigarettes a day it is about 70 percent higher than for non-smokers; for those who smoke 20 to 39 a day, 90 percent higher; and for those who smoke 40 or more, it is 120 percent higher.  "Cigarette smokers who stopped smoking before enrolling in the seven studies have a death rate about 40 percent higher than non-smokers, as against 70 percent higher than for current cigarette smokers. Men who began smoking before age 20 have substantially higher death rate than those who began after 25 ... "  Of smokers' personality it said: "A clear-cut smoker's personality has not emerged from the results so far published. "While smokers differ from non-smokers in a variety of characteristics, none of the studies has shown a single variable which is shown solely in one group and is completely absent in another. Nor has any single variable been verified in a sufficiently large proportion of smokers and in sufficiently few non-smokers to consider it an 'essential' aspect of smoking."

Netflix Promises To Quit Smoking On (Most) Original Programming 
.W 
Netflix said future shows aimed at its younger audiences will not depict smoking or e-cigarette use unless it is "essential." The streaming content giant also says information about smoking will be included as part of its ratings. Matt Rourke / AP There's a scene in the hit Netflix series Stranger Things where the skeptical police chief, Chief Jim Hopper, is at his desk chomping on an apple. He listens to a theory that a local teen may have been kidnapped by Russian spies. Fed up, he spits out the fruit, sticks a cigarette in his mouth and lights up. But Netflix has now pledged to cut down on moments like this: The streaming content giant announced Wednesday that it will stub out depictions of smoking across all of its original shows aimed at younger viewers. The announcement comes on the heels of a new report by the anti-smoking group Truth Initiative released earlier this week. The study looked at several of the most popular programs among 15-to-24-year-olds and found that the amount of tobacco imagery in them has more than tripled in the past year. The group's research shows smoking and e-cigarette depictions were most prevalent on Netflix, blowing away portrayals on cable or broadcast TV. The biggest offender? Season 2 of Stranger Things. The researchers found that 100% of the episodes they analyzed of the show — a supernatural story about adolescents, set in the 1980s — included tobacco use. The Truth Initiative timed the release of its now-annual report to coincide with Thursday's debut of season 3 of Stranger Things. In a statement, Netflix told Variety that it will not show smoking or e-cigarette use in future shows with ratings of TV-14 or below, as well as all films rated PG-13 or below, except for "reasons of historical or factual accuracy." The company added that it would also limit depictions of smoking in projects with higher age ratings, "unless it's essential to the creative vision of the artist or because it's character-defining (historically or culturally important.)" Netflix also said information about smoking will be included as part of its ratings. The Truth Initiative noted that the pervasive rise of smoking on the small screen could pose a significant threat to a new generation of young Americans. "Based on estimated viewership of these programs, results suggest that approximately 28 million young people were exposed to tobacco through television and streaming programs in these most popular shows alone," the group said. "That exposure is a significant public health concern, because viewing tobacco use in on-screen entertainment media is a critical factor associated with young people starting to smoke." A 2014 report by the U.S. Surgeon General concluded "an R-rating for movies with smoking would avert one million tobacco deaths among today's children and adolescents."

E-cigarettes removed from banned list for county workers 
.W 
Nye County employees will be able to use electronic cigarettes within the county’s properties.  Nye County commissioners voted last week to remove the devices, commonly called e-cigarettes, from the list of tobacco products that are prohibited within any building owned, leased and utilized by Nye County.  It was the only amendment for the Nye County Personnel Policy Manual approved Dec. 6.  Electronic cigarettes are not a tobacco product and many use them to kick the habit of using tobacco, much like patches or gum, Nye County Commissioner Lorinda Wichman said.  “Electronic cigarettes are not tobacco use and they are a method to eliminate tobacco use and for people to quit smoking,” Wichman said.  Wichman said she is the only commissioner on the board who uses e-cigarettes.  Under the original rules for use of tobacco in the county’s personnel policy, the prohibition extended to areas that are routinely or regularly used by employees, including but not limited to work areas, restrooms, hallways, employee lounges, cafeterias, conference and meeting rooms, lobbies and vehicles Nye County owns or uses.  The county also shall not allow the use of tobacco products during staff and training meetings, according to the documents.  “I’m spending as much as eight or 10 hours in county vehicles and I would not have voted for that,” Wichman said.  The section in the manual titled ‘Tobacco Use’ was adopted at the April meeting. During that meeting, commissioners discussed medical marijuana use and policies, but didn’t discuss the use of tobacco products.  At the meeting last week, commissioners also adopted the language for information technology policies and social media policies for Nye County employees.  The language for information technology policies specifies guidelines for privacy of employees when using the county’s electronic and telecommunication properties, systems, or services; prohibited use. The language for social media policies specifies guidelines for employee monitoring, authorized social networking, personal blogs and social networking sites.  “It was standard language changes to keep the manual moving forward with new technology,” Wichman said.

Youth Smoking Decline Stalls; Vaping May Be Cause 
.W 
Cigarette smoking rates have stopped falling among U.S. kids, and health officials believe youth vaping is responsible. For decades, the percentage of high school and middle school students who smoked cigarettes had been declining fairly steadily. For the past three years, it has flattened, according to new numbers released Monday. There may be several reasons, but a recent boom in vaping is the most likely explanation, said Brian King of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "We were making progress, and now you have the introduction of a product that is heavily popular among youth that has completely erased that progress," King said. The CDC findings come from a national survey conducted last spring of more than 20,000 middle and high school students. It asked if they had used any tobacco products in the previous month. Some of the findings had been released before, including the boom in vaping. Experts attribute the vaping increase to the exploding popularity of newer versions of e-cigarettes, like those by Juul Labs Inc. of San Francisco. The products resemble computer flash drives, can be recharged in USB ports and can be used discreetly — including in school bathrooms and even in classrooms. According to the new CDC data, about 8 percent of high schoolers said they had recently smoked cigarettes in 2018, and about 2 percent of middle schoolers did. Those findings were about the same seen in similar surveys in 2016 and 2017. It also found that about 2 in 5 high school students who used a vaping or tobacco product used more than one kind, and that the most common combination was e-cigarettes and cigarettes. Also, about 28 percent of high school e-cigarette users said they vaped 20 or more days in the previous month — nearly a 40 percent jump from the previous year. Smoking, the nation's leading cause of preventable illness, is responsible for more than 480,000 deaths each year. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration bans the sale of e-cigarettes and tobacco products to those under 18. E-cigarettes are generally considered better than cigarettes for adults who are already addicted to nicotine. But health officials have worried for years that electronic cigarettes could lead kids to switch to smoking traditional cigarettes. "I think the writing is on the wall," with research increasingly suggesting e-cigarettes are becoming a gateway to regular cigarettes, said Megan Roberts, an Ohio State University researcher. There is, however, some split of opinion among health researchers. Some had linked e-cigarettes to an unusually large drop in teen smoking a few years ago, and they say it's not clear to what extent the decline in smoking has stalled or to what degree vaping is to blame. Cigarette smoking is still declining in some states. And another large survey found that smoking has continued to drop among 12th graders, though not in younger school kids. "It's not clear yet what's going on and it's best to not jump to any conclusions," said David Levy, a Georgetown University researcher. In a statement, a Juul spokeswoman said the company has taken steps to prevent children from using its products and supports prohibiting sales of e-cigarettes to anyone under 21.

Yogi government has lifted the ban on the manufacture and sale of `paan masala` in Uttar Pradesh, Photo: Reuters Written By: IANS Updated: Thu, May 07, 202010:38 am Lucknow, IANS The Yogi government has lifted the ban on the manufacture and sale of `paan masala` in Uttar Pradesh. The sale of `gutka` and tobacco, however, will not be allowed. Commissioner Food Safety and Drug Administration Anita Singh has issued the order saying that the exemption is for plain paan masala. The ban on the manufacture, storage and sale of tobacco and nicotine-free pan masala/gutkha in the state will continue unchanged. The state government has also allowed stationery and book shops to open in the green and orange zones, maintaining social distancing norms. Though many government and private schools have started giving online classes amid the lockdown, students claimed the unavailability of books was affecting the studies. The sale of books and stationery has been welcomed by parents and students who said that online classes, in the absence of books, were making studying difficult for them. "We have been getting queries from parents on how students can study without books. The concrete studies can start only when students have books," said Rita Kaushal, a teacher in a local secondary school.

How $200K will help SouthCoast towns combat tobacco use 
.W 
Tuesday Aug 14, 2018 at 5:43 PMAug 14, 2018 at 5:43 PM The state Department of Public Health is awarding more than $6 million over the next four years to prevent nicotine use and improve public health. Among those communities receiving grants are New Bedford and Fall River. According to a DPH news release, Fall River is getting $98,000 (also serving Attleboro, Berkley, Dighton, Norton, Somerset, Swansea, Taunton, and Westport) while New Bedford is receiving $90,000 (also serving Acushnet, Dartmouth, Fairhaven, Freetown, Marion, and Rochester.) “Massachusetts continues to develop comprehensive approaches to reduce tobacco and nicotine use among young people and adults,” Secretary of Health and Human Services Marylou Sudders said in the release. “Local communities throughout the state will use this funding to build and strengthen their efforts to educate the public about the health effects of tobacco use and exposure to secondhand smoke, and direct individuals to cessation resources.” The funding, a combination of state and federal dollars, will help communities establish and maintain comprehensive tobacco control programs based on the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Best Practices designed to: • Protect youth from exposure to tobacco and vaping industry tactics and prevent youth initiation of tobacco/nicotine use • Protect residents from secondhand smoke • Ensure all Massachusetts users of tobacco/nicotine have access to cessation resources • Identify tobacco-related disparities and target efforts toward those disproportionately affected "For more than 20 years, DPH’s efforts have resulted in significant progress in preventing tobacco use and helping smokers quit for good,” said Public Health Commissioner Monica Bharel. “Despite this progress, these awards come at a time when vaping rates among youth are 9 times higher than adults.” On July 27, Gov. Charlie Baker signed a bill which raises the legal age to buy tobacco products statewide from 18 to 21. The new law broadens existing prohibitions on public smoking to include e-cigarettes and prohibits the use of tobacco products on the grounds of any public or private primary, secondary, or vocational school. Additionally, pharmacies, hospitals, or other entities that offer health care services or employ any licensed health care providers are prohibited from selling tobacco products. Earlier this month, DPH launched its first statewide public information campaign to educate parents of middle and high school-aged children about the dangers of vape pens and e-cigarettes. The campaign, The New Look of Nicotine Addiction, seeks to spread the word that these high-tech products are harmful and that they contain nicotine which can damage a teenager’s developing brain and lead to addiction.

Tasmania news: Basslink out until October, petition to stop Hobart smoking ban fails 
.W 
The union representing paramedics says the state's ambulance service is buckling under pressure, after an internal email asked staff to cancel planned leave if they no longer needed it. In the email obtained by the ABC, Ambulance Tasmania told staff there were shortages due to unpredicted leave and more shortages were expected in the coming weeks. Health and Community Services Union state secretary Tim Jacobson said northern staff were being asked to cover the south. "Calling people from Launceston to work in Hobart just moves the problem from Hobart to Launceston," he said. "The Government doesn't seem to understand that we have a major problem, and the epicentre isn't Hobart, it is everywhere." In a statement, an Ambulance Tasmania spokesman said no leave had been cancelled, but staff had been asked to voluntarily reschedule leave if they were able to, due to higher than anticipated unplanned leave. Remote students facing longer bus trips Students at a remote Tasmanian school could soon be forced to sit on a bus for two and a half hours a day to get to and from school, due to uncertainty over a school bus contract. The Mountain Heights School at Queenstown on the west coast currently has two bus lines, one takes students to Zeehan in the north and the other taking children to Strahan in the west. The contract for the bus to Zeehan expires at the end of this year and there is currently no certainty about what will happen with the route. Infrastructure Minister Michael Ferguson said the Government stepped in to find an operator for the school to Zeehan service when the last operator pulled out, and said the community would be supported so it was no worse off. Weather For forecast for Tasmania is for showers about the west and far south, with light showers about the north. Mainly fine elsewhere. Winds will be west to north-westerly becoming fresh and gusty during the day. Showers are also forecast for tomorrow with snow to 600 metres in the afternoon.

Parliament: Bill tabled to raise minimum smoking age from 18 to 21 
.W 
SINGAPORE - Singapore took its first legal step towards raising the minimum smoking age from 18 to 21, with a new bill presented in Parliament on Monday.  If passed, the bill to amend the Tobacco (Control of Advertisements and Sale) Act will also make it illegal for people to own imitation tobacco products such as e-cigarettes.  Currently, it is against the law to import, distribute, sell or offer to sell such products. With the changes, those who own e-cigarettes can also be fined up to $2,000.  The bill was tabled by Health Minister Gan Kim Yong for the first reading. It will be debated at a future sitting.  In a statement attached to the bill, the health ministry said that raising the minimum legal age is intended "to reduce, with a view to ultimately eliminating, the opportunities for the young to be tempted and take up smoking before attaining 21 years of age".  In Singapore, the years between age 18 and 21 are when nearly half of smokers start to light up on a regular basis. The average age at which people began to lit up has also gone down, from 17 in 2001 to 16 in 2013.  Nee Soon GRC MP Louis Ng, who is a former smoker, called the proposed amendment a "crucial step forward".  "I started smoking when I was about 18 years old," he said. "Research by the World Health Organisation shows that people who don't pick up smoking before age 21 are unlikely to ever start."  Medical experts welcomed the proposed changes, but said they should be complemented by other anti-smoking measures.  This includes more prominent public campaigns such as deterrent ads on buses, and higher taxes such as in Australia where a packet of cigarettes can cost over AUD$30, said Dr K. Thomas Abraham, chief executive of Sata CommHealth which conducts community health programmes. Stronger enforcement action is also required, he added.  Dr Tan Kok Kuan, a resident doctor at Dr Tan & Partners @ Novena, said though that there is a case to be made for permitting certain types of e-cigarettes that contain tobacco but no flavorings.  These provide smokers with the nicotine fix, but are less likely to entice young smokers, he said.  "I'm of the opinion that being 100 per cent smoke free is not possible," he said. "It makes sense to allow products which are not healthy, but are less harmful than the ones we currently have."

New York City has voted to extend its strict smoking ban to e-cigarettes, barring them from bars, restaurants, parks, beaches and other public places.  The bill is expected to be signed by Mayor Michael Bloomberg in the coming days and will then come into effect after 180 days.  E-cigarettes are battery-powered and deliver doses of nicotine and other additives via aerosol.  They are sold as a safer alternative to traditional cigarettes that can even help smokers quit their habit.

Those who can’t smoke don’t turn into food addicts 
.W 
New York, Sep 20 (IANS) Smokers who quit or abstain for whatever reason do not generally turn their gaze towards mouth-watering food as normally thought. According to researchers from University at Buffalo, smoking abstinence doesn’t greatly affect the motivation for food. “We found that the motivations for cigarettes, food and water do not interact very much,” said Stephen Tiffany from the university’s department of psychology. “The results suggest that smoking abstinence does not affect the motivation for food and water”. The study, published in the journal Drug and Alcohol Dependence, used cues and actual money to learn how much smokers might spend for cigarettes, food and water during abstinence. The results provide new insights for how different systems control motivation and reward. Food does not become more appealing during those times when a smoker is in a smoke-free environment or otherwise can’t smoke. “If you’re on an airplane and can’t smoke, you’re not likely to be spending more money than usual on snacks,” said Tiffany. For the current study, 50 participants, all smokers who had abstained for 12 hours, had money to spend on their choices. Tiffany and Jennifer Betts, the study’s co-author, sat those participants in front of a box with a sliding door. Inside the box was one of three items: their favourite brand of cigarette, a candy bar they previously acknowledged as liking, or a cup of water. During the study, non-abstinent smokers spent more money for cigarettes than for food. And more money for food than for water. Abstinent smokers spent even more for cigarettes, but they didn’t spend for food or for water. “When people are abstinent from cigarettes their craving tends to go up, but they don’t become hypersensitive to the cue,” said Tiffany. People don’t relapse randomly. They relapse in the presence of opportunities to use which can be triggered by cues, the researchers noted.

Is smoking in public park a constitutional right? Supreme Court refuses case 
.W 
Arthur Gallagher, a smoker, challenged a ban on lighting up in city buildings, parks, and playgrounds in Clayton, Mo. The Supreme Court turned away the case Monday.  The US Supreme Court declined on Monday to take up a case testing whether smokers have a constitutional right to light up in a public park.  The high court turned aside the appeal without comment.  The question arose in a lawsuit filed against the City of Clayton, Mo., and its officials after the Board of Aldermen passed a 2010 ordinance prohibiting smoking in city buildings, parks, and playgrounds.  Arthur Gallagher, a smoker, sued the city and its officials claiming the ban violated a fundamental right to consume ignited tobacco. He said he was a regular visitor to city parks who “ecstatically enjoys smoking tobacco products while doing so.”  “We decline Gallagher’s invitation to declare smoking a fundamental right,” the three-judge panel of the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals said in its decision.  The court also rejected Gallagher’s argument that the city had no rational reason justifying a ban on smoking in an open-air park because secondhand smoke would quickly dissipate. No member of the public could possibly be harmed, Gallagher had insisted.  When the board enacted the ban, it cited public health and safety, litter reduction, and preserving the aesthetics of city property. (The city did not assert a desire to prevent fires as a reason to ban smoking in public buildings and parks, the appeals court noted.)  The board relied on a 1999 National Cancer Institute report that said secondhand smoke is responsible for the early deaths of 53,000 Americans each year, the appeals court said. The board also considered a 2006 report from the US surgeon general that concluded there was no risk-free level of exposure to secondhand smoke.  Gallagher said the reports addressed indoor secondhand smoke, not outdoor secondhand smoke.  The appeals court rejected Gallagher’s argument. To survive the relatively easy standard of rational basis review, the city must only show a plausible reason to justify the new ordinance.  “We need not determine whether outdoor secondhand smoke exposure actually causes harm,” the appeals court said. “Because the City reasonably could believe this to be true, the Ordinance survives rational basis review.”  The case was Gallagher v. City of Clayton (12-1122).

KU among first to ban plastic bags in Sindh: Wahab 
.W 
Karachi The University of Karachi is the first university in the province which has completely banned the use of plastic bags on the campus. It is also among those few which have welcomed the decision of the Sindh government to put a ban on the use of plastic bags by implementing the government’s initiative. By reducing the use of plastic bags and growing trees in large numbers, we can play a very vital role in minimizing the environmental hazards. The government cannot bring changes alone; it always needs public support to successfully run and implement its drive. These views were expressed by the adviser to the provincial chief minister on law, environment and coastal development, Barrister Murtaza Wahab, on Wednesday. He was addressing as chief guest a seminar, titled ‘Environmental Awareness and Plantation Drive 2019’, which was held at the Karachi University Business Administration’s auditorium. The seminar was organised to create awareness regarding Karachi’s environmental issues and what would be the role of the masses to make environment clean and green. Wahab shared that during recent heavy rainfall he had witnessed that sewerage lines were unable to clear the rainwater as most of them were filled with plastic bags and solid waste material due to which the drainage system was chocked. “Public after using plastic bags carelessly throw it away and later it becomes problem for the governments and other concerned departments and agencies. We have to create awareness among the masses that they should not use plastic bags anymore and put their garbage in the dumping centres.” He mentioned that the provincial and federal governments worked on legislation and after debating every aspect of proposed law they passed it to implement for the betterment of the society. However, he said that we also have to create awareness regarding the laws so that they could be enforced in letter and spirit. He said that laws are passed to facilitate public and people should also put them into practice; otherwise, society would not get any benefit from such laws. “If, we plant a tree today, it will benefit our children in future. We shouldn’t be happy after planting a sapling only. We also have to take good care of the plant until it grows completely.” Wahab urged that every citizen should take part in the plantation drive and the Sindh government would provide whatever was needed to plant a sapling. KU Vice Chancellor Professor Dr Khalid Mahmood Iraqi said that Karachi was facing many environmental issues, severely affecting its biophysical environment as well as human health. He further said that air pollution, lack of proper waste management infrastructure and degradation of water bodies were major environmental issues in Karachi. He observed that at the present rate of development and economic growth we were rapidly depleting the natural resource base on which man’s existence depended. “Karachi University has a commitment to a better environmental future of the country. This university is a history setter and now we have set a history by following the right roadmap and setting healthy traditions in the campus.” Dr Iraqi added that the University of Karachi was developing linkages in the field of environment and working on installing pollution control technology through consultation and technical guidance in the campus. He mentioned that trees and plants were the prime source of environmental purification and beautification and played an essential role on a grand scale as well as on local level. Earlier, Professor Dr Moazzam Ali Khan, through a presentation, shed light on Karachi’s civic problems. He informed the audience that 75 percent of total solid waste collected from various parts of the city could be recycled and reused and there was no harm is using recycled items. He said that the city required around 100 million gallons of additional water per day (MGD) after every five years to bridge the gap of demand and supply. In 2015, the requirement of the water in Karachi was over 1,100 MGD from several sources, but it was only getting 650 MGD and still there was a huge gap in demand and supply. “Our air is polluted, we are facing water shortfall while there isn’t proper treatment of the sewerage system. This city produces 20,000 metric tons of solid waste daily and most of them are left unattended or being burnt in the open.” He said that this was our everyday business and it was everyone’s business that was why we all must have to work together to bring about change in the society. We should not throw our garbage outside our homes and should act as sensible citizens. He said that environmental issues were a subject of attitude and there was need to change attitude to bring about positive changes in the society. Professor Dr Moazzam Khan added that rather than blaming governments and other relevant agencies, citizens should take some initiatives to make their areas clean and green. Later, Barrister Wahab, Dr Iraqi, deans of all faculties, Iqra University VC Dr Waseem Qazi planted a sapling to launch a three-day plantation drive on the campus. All the departments, centres and institutions of the varsity also participated in the drive along with students and faculty members. The KU also introduced cloth bags as replacement for plastic bags at the end of the seminar. The University of Karachi is the first university in the province which has completely banned the use of plastic bags on the campus. It is also among those few which have welcomed the decision of the Sindh government to put a ban on the use of plastic bags by implementing the government’s initiative.

He said that laws are passed to facilitate public and people should also put them into practice; otherwise, society would not get any benefit from such laws. “If, we plant a tree today, it will benefit our children in future. We shouldn’t be happy after planting a sapling only. We also have to take good care of the plant until it grows completely.” Wahab urged that every citizen should take part in the plantation drive and the Sindh government would provide whatever was needed to plant a sapling. KU Vice Chancellor Professor Dr Khalid Mahmood Iraqi said that Karachi was facing many environmental issues, severely affecting its biophysical environment as well as human health. He further said that air pollution, lack of proper waste management infrastructure and degradation of water bodies were major environmental issues in Karachi. He observed that at the present rate of development and economic growth we were rapidly depleting the natural resource base on which man’s existence depended. “Karachi University has a commitment to a better environmental future of the country. This university is a history setter and now we have set a history by following the right roadmap and setting healthy traditions in the campus.” Dr Iraqi added that the University of Karachi was developing linkages in the field of environment and working on installing pollution control technology through consultation and technical guidance in the campus. He mentioned that trees and plants were the prime source of environmental purification and beautification and played an essential role on a grand scale as well as on local level. Earlier, Professor Dr Moazzam Ali Khan, through a presentation, shed light on Karachi’s civic problems. He informed the audience that 75 percent of total solid waste collected from various parts of the city could be recycled and reused and there was no harm is using recycled items. He said that the city required around 100 million gallons of additional water per day (MGD) after every five years to bridge the gap of demand and supply. In 2015, the requirement of the water in Karachi was over 1,100 MGD from several sources, but it was only getting 650 MGD and still there was a huge gap in demand and supply. “Our air is polluted, we are facing water shortfall while there isn’t proper treatment of the sewerage system. This city produces 20,000 metric tons of solid waste daily and most of them are left unattended or being burnt in the open.” He said that this was our everyday business and it was everyone’s business that was why we all must have to work together to bring about change in the society. We should not throw our garbage outside our homes and should act as sensible citizens. He said that environmental issues were a subject of attitude and there was need to change attitude to bring about positive changes in the society. Professor Dr Moazzam Khan added that rather than blaming governments and other relevant agencies, citizens should take some initiatives to make their areas clean and green. Later, Barrister Wahab, Dr Iraqi, deans of all faculties, Iqra University VC Dr Waseem Qazi planted a sapling to launch a three-day plantation drive on the campus. All the departments, centres and institutions of the varsity also participated in the drive along with students and faculty members. The KU also introduced cloth bags as replacement for plastic bags at the end of the seminar.

UK Health Groups Recommend Use Of E-Cigarettes As Smoking Cessation Tool 
.W 
Health officials in the United Kingdom believe that e-cigarettes could be a helpful tool in helping people quit smoking.  Contrary to the view of health officials in the United States that using e-cigarettes could pose detrimental effects to health, those from the United Kingdom think otherwise. In fact, they believe that e-cigarettes are less harmful than normal cigarettes and these could be used as an important tool in helping most smokers quit tobacco altogether.  Public Health England (PHE), a group of health officials from more than 70 organizations in the United Kingdom, released an independent review of the evidence that assessed the effects of e-cigarettes to health.  E-cigarettes are 95 percent less harmful to the body because these do not contain free radicals, PHE found.  The agency believes that using e-cigarettes as a "stop smoking" aid can be helpful since these provide a high-nicotine hit that other nicotine delivery products do not give. This will help smokers work their way down to a zero dosage, effectively weaning off from nicotine addiction completely.  In the assessment report released, key findings show that smokers who tried other methods to quit smoking and had no result can be urged to try using e-cigarettes instead. This can be done through the help of health professionals who can provide behavioral support.  The use of e-cigarettes can help reduce smoking-related diseases, health inequalities and death, the officials reiterated. E-cigarettes can be used by those who can't abruptly stop smoking or those who don't want to stop.  Health officials also found that e-cigarettes can help people quit smoking and actually reduce the consumption of cigarettes. Though more research is needed, the officials said that there is evidence that e-cigarettes can encourage quitting or reducing cigarette consumption even among those who do not intend to quit smoking.  "We believe this review will prove a valuable resource, explaining the relative risks and benefits of e-cigarettes, in terms of harm reduction when compared with cigarettes and as an aid to quitting," said [PDF] Duncan Selbie, chief executive of PHE.  "We will continue to monitor the position and will add to the evidence base and guidance going forward," he added.

Implementing a smoke-free hospital site policy 
.W 
Turning an entire hospital site into a smoke-free environment sounds like a daunting project but good communication and careful preparation can lead to success.  In 2013 NICE recommended that hospital sites become smoke-free. The guidance noted that smoking cessation can have considerable health benefits, and patients in hospital who quit benefit from shorter lengths of stay and fewer complications.  Since 2013 our trust’s policy included a partial ban on smoking across the site with the provision of three external smoking shelters for patient and visitor use only. All staff, patients, carers and the general public had access to the on-site or community-based stop smoking services. Our new policy, launched at the beginning of this year, aims to achieve a smoke-free site whereby smoking is not allowed on any part of the trust’s grounds.  We started planning the policy nine months before its launch. A neighbouring trust had decided to launch its policy on the same date, while two other local trusts had already done so. We were able to learn from their implementation and facilitate standardisation across the local health economy in Coventry and Warwickshire.  We set up a group of representatives from across the trust, which was led by the public health manager. Key stakeholders are outlined in Box 1.  The group met monthly and developed an action plan. Communication was vital, especially with staff and patients, and our neighbours who live and work near to the trust. This included local radio and newspaper coverage, delivering letters to local residents, briefing staff via a ward managers’ pack (including an example of the disciplinary process) and changing the wording of all patient leaflets and letters. We agreed a protocol across the trust for nicotine replacement therapy, and made stock available 24 hours a day for patients who wanted to manage without cigarettes during their stay and for those who wanted to quit.  Smokers who wanted to quit could access help from NHS Warwickshire Stop Smoking Service located in the ambulatory care unit at the hospital site or at a range of locations across Warwickshire.  All health professionals received brief intervention training, which takes a few minutes. The main messages are to:  Implementation went smoothly and we carried out a three-month evaluation. In the first few weeks we had a daily monitoring patrol, but this has now been reduced to weekly, in addition to security and staff reporting any breaches. So far we have had only one complaint from neighbours regarding staff congregating at the perimeters, and one member of staff received an informal warning for smoking offsite in uniform. The general feedback from smokers has been positive, with few adverse comments. Some staff are still reluctant to approach smokers on site because of the fear of violence and aggression, but by continuing to share the generally positive experiences of staff who have approached smokers we hope to dispel these anxieties.  Implementing a smoke-free policy can be daunting but collaboration, good communication and careful preparation are key to success. This includes the provision of education and training of staff and practical support for patients who smoke.

FDA tobacco director ignores 2.5 million 'anecdotal reports' about e-cigarettes 
.W 
Also noteworthy: In May, the CDC published smoking statistics from the 2015 NHIS, but it just this past week produced information on e-cigarettes.  Altogether, 3.5 percent of all USA adults were e-cigarette users in 2015, down slightly from 3.7 percent in 2014, the CDC survey found. That is more than double the 13 percent youth cigarette-smoking rate in Montana. National studies report an increase in use of smokeless tobacco by high school athletes and found that athletes were nearly 80 percent more likely to use smokeless tobacco products than non-athletes. In the same time period, high school students using e-cigarettes within the past 30 days rose from 1.5 percent to 2.8 percent. E-cigarettes are now more popular with teenagers than traditional cigarettes. Researchers have also reported that teens who use e-cigarettes are more likely to switch to using regular cigarettes. In 2015, 24 percent of high school students were current users of e-cigarettes, compared to 11 percent who smoked cigarettes, a previous CDC survey found. This raises concern that there may be young people for whom e-cigarettes could be an entry point to use of conventional tobacco products, including cigarettes.  While some people will claim that e-cigarettes are better than traditional tobacco products, the fact is they are still a nicotine delivery system. Tobacco use and addiction mostly begin during adolescence. This would discourage smokers in North Dakota from using these products to quit, which seems to contradict the supposed reason for this huge tax increase.  "These data show a dramatic rise in usage of e-cigarettes by youth, and this is cause for great concern as we don't yet understand the long-term effects of these novel tobacco products", said Mitch Zeller, director of FDA's Center for Tobacco Products. They constitute population-level evidence. FDA is required to use a population health standard. However, there are proven cessation strategies and treatments, including counseling and FDA-approved cessation medications. Don't be tricked by Big Tobacco, get involved today!

Navigating Cancer 2/21/2017: E-cigarettes may be a safer alternative 
.W 
If you have watched television lately, you have seen the campaign directed at eliminating smoking altogether. In an attempt to stop smoking, many people turn to e-  cigarettes in an attempt to quit, or at least as an alternative to cigarettes with a feeling that the e-cigarette will be safer.  As the use of e-cigarettes continues to rise, concerns about their long-term effects on health have persisted. But now, a new study finds that smokers who switch to e-cigarettes only, much like those who switch to nicotine replacement therapy only, have fewer carcinogens and toxins in their bodies after six months, than those who continue to smoke cigarettes. This is important because it adds to the growing evidence that e-  cigarettes are a much safer alternative to smoking conventional tobacco cigarettes. This study, funded by the Cancer Research UK was recently published in the Annals of Internal Medicine.  The impact and cost of cigarettes is enormous. According to the World Health Organization, tobacco use kills around 5 million people per year, and more than 600,000 non-smokers who are exposed to second-hand smoke. Yes, 600,000 non-smokers.  Why is tobacco smoke so dangerous? At least 250 of the 4,000 chemicals in tobacco smoke are known to be harmful, including 50 that are known to cause cancer.  Electronic cigarettes are battery-operated devices that deliver nicotine that can be flavored, as well as other chemicals through vapor instead of smoke. In the United States, there are more than 250 brands of e-cigarettes on the market. Some look like traditional combustible cigarettes, cigars or pipes that deliver nicotine by burning tobacco, while others look like everyday items such as USB memory sticks and even your basic ink pens. While e-cigarettes are often promoted as safer alternatives to traditional, combustible cigarettes, the authors of the new study note that there has not been much research on the long-term health effects of the electronic cigarettes.  In some previous reports, research has suggested that e-cigarettes cause as much harm as combustible cigarettes, but the study authors note that they are based on research that does not reflect real-world exposure of e-cigarette users. The new study is the first of its kind because it analyzes intake of potentially harmful chemicals. Previous studies have measured potential toxicity of e-cigarettes by analyzing chemicals in the products and the vapor they produce.  In this study, researchers looked at saliva and urine samples, and measured the intake of potentially harmful chemicals in various groups of people, including former smokers who used e-cigarettes only for six months, former smokers who used licensed nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) only for six months, and smokers who continued to smoke regular cigarettes.  The results showed that while their levels of nicotine remained much the same, former smokers who had used e-cigarettes only or NRT only for six months had significantly lower levels of toxic chemicals and carcinogens in their bodies than the people who continued to smoke combustible cigarettes. However, participants who used e-cigarettes or NRT while continuing to smoke regular cigarettes did not show the same large reduction, suggesting that there must be a complete switch from traditional cigarettes to an e-cigarette to see a significant reduction in exposure to toxins.  In this study, researchers have shown that the levels of toxic chemicals in the body from e-cigarettes are considerably lower than suggested in previous studies using simulated experiments. This means some doubts about the safety of e-cigarettes may be wrong. The bottom line is that e-cigarettes appear to be much safer than traditional cigarettes. In course, the best approach is to stop smoking any type of products, traditional cigarettes and e-cigarettes, but at least this data suggest that e-cigarettes may be a useful long-term aid to smoking cessation for people who struggle to quit using other methods; however, the health benefits will only occur if users stop smoking traditional cigarettes altogether.

Prisoners to be banned from smoking behind bars 
.W 
Prisoners are to be banned from smoking in eight prisons across England and Wales amid warnings the move could lead to unrest behind bars and legal challenges .  Inmates will not be able to buy or use tobacco in the jails from January, while those in open prisons will be barred from lighting up indoors from next month.  The Ministry of Justice announced the ban as the first stage of a national roll-out, and issued the findings of a scientific report showing prison officers were being exposed to “significant” amounts of second-hand smoke while on duty.  Andrew Selous, the prisons minister, said: “We have no plans to move to smoke free prisons overnight and will only do so in a phased way that takes into account operational resilience and readiness of each prison.  “The operational safety and security of our prisons will always be our top priority.”  Prisoners will be given access to e-cigarettes and products to help them give up the habit.  Mark Leech, editor of the Prisons Handbook, said: “We could have a very difficult time ahead of us – prisons are full of people with mental illness, who suffer from impulsive behaviour and who can be violent.  “I fear there will be unrest over this. There is also always the prospect of legal challenges.”  An independent report commissioned by the Ministry of Justice found prison officers spent on average one hour in six per shift exposed to secondary smoke above guidance levels.  The officers’ exposure to smoke was “at times significant” – for example, in Cardiff prison staff were exposed to levels of secondary smoke for more than three quarters of their shift.  Electronic measuring showed one officer was exposed to 1,027 micrograms of particulates per cubic metre, compared with a World Health Organisation recommended limit of 25 micrograms.  Sean Humber, a prison lawyer representing non-smoking prisoners concerned at their exposure to tobacco smoke, said: “In light of these monitoring results, which indicate that prison staff and non-smokers are currently being exposed to potentially unhealthy levels of cigarette smoke, it seems likely that the remaining prisons in England will need to go smoke free soon after these first four.”  • What is Stoptober and why is it popular?  All four Welsh prisons will go smoke-free from January along with jails at Exeter, Channings Wood and Dartmoor, all in Devon, and Erlestoke, in Wiltshire.

Police and the Tobacco Officers had charged 5 people with smoking in a public place an inter-island vessel, yesterday.  The incident occurred during the vessel’s boarding on a trip to the outer islands.  Tobacco officer of the Ministry of Health Le’omolotu Havea said these people were fined because all licensed premises such as shipping vessels, buses and taxis are smoke free areas.  They were fined to pay TOP$100.00 each.  The duo also fined a 26 year old female vendor from Fasi moe Afi with TOP$200.00 due to the retail sale of tobacco sticks at a public area.  Since the operation started last year, close to 200 people have been fined and close to TOP$20, 000 collected from the operation with the youngest fined, a 13 year old.  Le’omolotu said people who are dissatisfied with the Act can prepare a petition regarding the issue and submit to parliament.

Campaign Urges Smokers to Enlist Doctors' Help in Quitting 
.W 
Campaign Urges Smokers to Enlist Doctors' Help in Quitting  TUESDAY, May 28 (HealthDay News) -- Getting help and advice from a doctor more than doubles the chances that smokers can kick the habit, and U.S. health officials and medical groups are launching a new campaign to make that happen for the nearly 70 percent of smokers who say they want to quit.  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has teamed up with five national physician groups to create the "Talk With Your Doctor" campaign. As its name implies, the campaign was established to encourage smokers to ask a doctor for help in quitting. The campaign also calls on doctors to ask their patients if they need help to stop smoking.  "Taking just a few minutes to talk to your patients about smoking can double the odds of them successfully quitting," said Surgeon General Dr. Regina Benjamin in a CDC news release. "As a physician, I know that clinicians and their staff can play an incredibly important role in helping smokers move from thinking about quitting to taking real steps toward successful quitting."  The "Talk With Your Doctor" campaign will combine with the existing "Tips From Former Smokers'' campaign from May 27 through June 2. Ads will appear on national television and online.  "Smokers have told us that hard-hitting, emotionally powerful ads like these provide the motivation they need, and the response to the ads supports that," CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden said in the news release. "We believe 'Talk With Your Doctor' will amplify and expand the great success of 'Tips' and offer more encouragement for smokers to quit for good. We hope doctors will offer evidence based counseling and medications to all patients who can benefit from them."  As part of this effort, doctors will also be offered educational materials and training on tobacco interventions.  The new campaign involves the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Physicians and the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.  "I've been a practicing physician who's helped patients quit, and treated some of the terrible diseases in those who didn't quit in time," Dr. Tim McAfee, director of the CDC's Office on Smoking and Health, said in the release. "The message of the 'Tips' campaign and our new 'Talk With Your Doctor' campaign is simple: Quit smoking now. Or better yet, don't start. Studies show that the sooner you quit the better. And there is nothing you can do to add more years to your life than to quit smoking."  Cigarette smoking kills an estimated 440,000 Americans each year, and 43 million Americans are current smokers.  The American Cancer Society provides a guide to quitting smoking.

Examining The Malleability Of Cigarette Product Preference 
.W 
Author Date of Award 2019 Document Type Dissertation Degree Name Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Department Psychology First Advisor Stephen T. Higgins Abstract Introduction: Cigarette preference increases as a function of nicotine content, but preference can be shifted by manipulating cigarette cost. The aim of the present study is to model whether the behavioral-economic metric of unit price (cigarette cost/nicotine content) accounts for cigarette preference shifts and whether preference changes to very low nicotine content cigarettes (VLNCs) are associated with corresponding changes in smoking rate. Methods: 169 daily smokers from populations vulnerable to smoking completed sessions in which choices between smoking normal nicotine content (NNC) (15.8mg/g) and VLNC (0.4mg/g) cigarettes were concurrently available. In Condition 1, choices for both products were available ad-lib at an equal cost of 10 responses/choice. In Condition 2, VLNCs were again available ad-lib at 10 responses/choice, but NNCs were available on a progressive-ratio (PR) schedule wherein response cost (and unit price) increased following each NNC choice (10,160,320…8400 responses/choice). Results were analyzed using ANOVAs and a binomial test (p Results: Participants preferred NNCs over VLNCs in Condition 1, but shifted preference to VLNCs in Condition 2 (p Conclusions: These results suggest that unit price of nicotine underpins cigarette preference and may provide a metric by which regulators can predict product preference and potentially impact it through policy. These results also demonstrate that VLNCs sustain lower smoking rates than NNCs even under acute laboratory conditions. Language en Number of Pages 74 p.

Altria has increased its dividend 48 times in 46 years, and has increased its profitability primarily by its tobacco operating companies focusing on four strong premium brands, Marlboro, Copenhagen, Skoal and Black & Mild.  All That is Expected  The maker of Marlboro cigarettes is continually ramping up its innovation process. It is taking the right initiatives to gain market dominance. This trend is going to continue. MO is all set to build a solid international presence, and it may be rightly said that it will find many tobacco huffers. Investors who have no issues with these companies should definitely consider taking up this company for consideration. It has been known for pumping steady returns to its shareholders. MO is poised to grow further in the near future, creating shareholder returns. Turning to innovative tobacco products, Nu Mark remains focused on building a robust portfolio of innovative tobacco products for adult smokers and vapors.  Altria is a dividend aristocrat despite hailing from an unhealthy industry, this company has a huge customer base. This company is known for becoming investors’ staple. It competes with premium brands and boasts of higher margins than most of them. Many have thought that the cigarette industry is a sunset industry because of the social stigmatization attached to it. But there is a silver lining to it since an increasing number of people are moving towards ecigarettes. Out of the global $169 billion tobacco industry, about $6 billion comes from ecigs. The U.S. is the largest e-cig market worth $1.7 billion as of 2014. This company has plenty of room for growth and to offer to its shareholders.  In the smokable segment, PM USA’s steady investments in Marlboro continued to strengthen the brand’s leadership position. In the smokeless segment, USSTC grew its volume, supported by retail share gains from Copenhagen and Skoal combined.  There is a decline in smoking rates, and the regulations are increasing. It is safer to invest in this company since people prefer the same brands over and over again. It has a steady balance sheet. The diversion into the ecigarettes will certainly add fuel to its growth. MO derives most of its profits from its ecigs. So we can rightly assume that a hefty amount of its revenues would be added by ecigs.  It is one of the most consistent companies and has increased its dividends y-o-y. For the past 46 years, it has increased its dividends. It had a remarkable quarter and I am bullish about this company.

Stop Smoking & Stay Healthy! 
.W 
In 2008, the Canadian Lung Association stated, “Tobacco kills about 45,000 Canadians a year. That’s more than the total number of deaths from car accidents, suicide, murder, fires, AIDS and accidental poisonings combined”. It has been shown that smoking increases your chance of heart disease, lung disease and many different types of cancer. It also damages your eyes, oral health, immune system and can lead to osteoporosis. Even though the dangers of smoking are well documented, many people are still caught in the habit. Why? It is a powerful addiction.  Cigarettes are mostly made from the tobacco plant, which contains highly addictive nicotine. Once a cigarette is lit, it contains over 4000 chemicals which mix together to form tar. This is why smoking, at any level, is dangerous for the health of all those exposed. The trouble is that cigarettes are not only physically addictive, they are also psychologically addictive, as associations are made between smoking and daily activities.  While the act of quitting is incredibly difficult, the health benefits are substantial. The Canadian Lung Association reports that within one year of quitting smoking your risk of dying from a heart attack drops by half. Naturopathic Doctor, Sara Celik gives a few additional facts. “Within 72 hours, your entire body will test 100% nicotine-free and over 90% of all nicotine metabolites (the chemicals it breaks down into) will now have passed via urine. Within 21 days, you may notice a stronger immune system, elevated energy levels, and a calm, relaxed body.”  TIPS TO STOP SMOKING!  LIST IT – Write down the reasons you want to quit smoking on a card and place it where you normally keep your cigarettes. Review the list during times of temptation, then wait and re-read until the urge has passed.  MAKE A STATEMENT - Set a specific day to quit, tell at least 10 friends that you are going to quit smoking for accountability, and then DO IT!  CLEAN HOUSE - Throw away all cigarettes, butts, matches, and ash trays.  USE SUBSTITUTES - Instead of smoking, chew on raw vegetables and fruit to avoid weight gain, not candy! If your fingers seem empty, play with a pencil.  BABY STEPS – Don’t focus on the next week, month or year. Take the process one day at a time. Try to replace overwhelming negative thoughts such as “I can’t do it, it’s too hard” with positive, optimistic messages.  EAT WELL – Clean up your diet and drink plenty of fresh fruit & vegetable juice during the first three days after you quit, to help flush nicotine out of your system.  VISUALIZE – Imagine yourself as a non-smoker without the side effects of nicotine and the satisfaction that comes from being in control of your life.  FIND FRIENDS – You are not alone! Realize that 40 million Americans have quit. If they can do it, so can you! Join a support group. It appears that doing so can increase success rates.  STRESS LESS- When you need to relax, try stretch management techniques, such as deep breathing exercises rather than reaching for a cigarette.  BE PREPARED – Journal your triggers, feelings and accomplishments. Avoid situations that you associate with smoking (i.e. drinking alcohol) and set up a plan to be prepared when faced with temptation.  GOLD STARS - Each day, reward yourself in a positive way by celebrating your accomplishments! Buy yourself something with the money you’ve saved or plan a special reward as a celebration for quitting.  ADDITIONAL HELP – Consider a 30-day supplement program to help expel mucus, repair the respiratory system, reduce cravings and help curb the effects of nicotine addiction in the brain. Celik explains that Naturopathic Doctors support the use of specific herbs, vitamins and amino acids to help make quitting easier!  Lung Support: Your lungs bring fresh oxygen into your body and remove carbon dioxide and other waste gases that your body doesn’t need. Optimal lung function is vital for your body to receive the oxygen it needs to power your bodies every process. If the respiratory tract is not in good health, it can become sluggish and result in congestion and/or poor functioning. Look for herbs to help expel mucous from the respiratory system, as well as soothe inflamed tissue and bronchial passages. Examples include mullein, thyme and fenugreek. In addition, consider antioxidants (such as N-acetyl-L-Cysteine, Vitamin C) that help to protect the respiratory system, allowing it to repair and rebuild faster.  Craving Reduction: Look for ingredients such as green tea extract, GABA and L-Tyrosine which work to help curb the effects of nicotine addiction in the brain.  Stress Management: Look for ingredients that help promote restfulness and relaxation as smokers often report anxiety and insomnia as problems associated with attempts in quitting. Examples include hops, skullcap, lemon balm and 5-HTP.

Massachusetts OKs ban on flavored vaping, tobacco products

Massachusetts OKs ban on flavored vaping, tobacco products FILE - In this Friday, Oct. 4, 2019 file photo, a woman using an electronic cigarette exhales a puff of smoke in Mayfield Heights, Ohio. Massachusetts lawmakers have approved the nation's toughest restrictions on flavored tobacco and vaping products, including menthol cigarettes. The ban was passed by the Senate early Thursday, Nov. 21, before the legislature broke for a holiday recess. It had earlier been passed by the state House of Representatives. BOSTON (AP) — Massachusetts lawmakers passed a groundbreaking ban Thursday on the sale of flavored tobacco and vaping products, including menthol cigarettes. The bill would also place a 75% excise tax on vaping products and require health insurers, including the state’s Medicaid program, to cover tobacco cessation counseling. “This nation-leading step will save lives,” Democratic House Speaker Robert DeLeo said. The ban was passed by the Senate early Thursday before the legislature broke for a holiday recess. It had earlier been passed by the state House of Representatives and now goes to the desk of Republican Gov. Charlie Baker. Baker hasn’t indicated whether or when he will sign the ban, but its chances are good. In September, he had declared a public health emergency and ordered a temporary ban on the sale of vaping products. The legislation would immediately ban the sale of flavored vaping products and would outlaw sales of menthol cigarettes starting June 1, 2020. The legislation responds to growing concern about the health effects of vaping products, including deaths. It is the first such statewide legislation in the country, according to Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids. “This legislation is a critical step to help end the worsening youth e-cigarette epidemic and stop tobacco companies from using appealing flavors to lure kids into a lifetime of addiction,” he said in a written statement. “It would make Massachusetts the first state in the nation to prohibit the sale of all flavored tobacco products.” The American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network also called it first-in-the-nation legislation. “More than 80% of teens who have ever used a tobacco product started with a flavored product, and the tobacco industry knows this,” the organization said in an emailed statement. Studies have shown menthol cigarettes are consumed disproportionately by young people and minorities, and anti-tobacco groups and health experts have argued menthol has been marketed in particular to African Americans. A major retailers’ organization called the legislation disappointing. “We are disappointed the legislature supports bills that disproportionately impact communities of color and have disastrous implications for public health, public safety, state tax revenue and jobs in the Commonwealth,” Jonathan Shaer, president of the New England Convenience Store Owners and Energy Marketers Association said in a statement. He called menthol and mint tobacco as “legal, adult products that aren’t associated with youth overuse.” Copyright 2019 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

.W 
Vaping-Supplies.co.uk has released a new brand of e-liquid products for use with vaporizers, e-cigs and more, and has introduced 12 new flavours to excite regular users.  Electronic cigarettes were first invented as a way to help people quit smoking, but their comparative ease of use, cleanliness and the ability to smoke indoors has instead guaranteed that the electronic cigarette is replacing the traditional combustible cigarette. The major reason for the success of the e-cigarette is e-liquid, a water based vapor that contains nicotine, but can be modulated to create almost any flavour imaginable. Vaping Supplies is an e-commerce store specializing in bringing the best e-liquids, e-cigarettes and vaporizers to the market, and is now offering Elda E-Liquid 4U Line. The new range includes twelve unique flavours and many more will added soon.  The new range of e-liquids includes glucoise tobacco flavour, mint choc, premium tobacco blend, toffee cream, classic Virginia, chocolate, chesterfield tobacco, and arctic menthol.

The range is now available for purchase on Vapping-Supplies.co.uk and each e liquid is displayed with high quality imagery, detailed product description, and clear and consistent pricing. The products are all made with the finest ingredients sourced exclusively from the EU and contain no GMOs.  A spokesperson for Vaping-Supplies.co.uk explained, “We are thrilled to be launching this brand new and unique range of bespoke e-liquid flavours. We discovered these after doing no small amount of research. Due to overwhelming requests from users for a greater variety of flavours, as well as for some specific best-loved flavours that current manufacturers weren’t supplying, we found Elda 4U Line were the perfect fit. These new products have filled those gaps, and are aiming to exceed expectations with superior quality and price. The products are available for purchase now, and provide an affordable, luxurious vaping experience whether using e-cigarettes or vaporizers. This product range is just the beginning, and we look forward to adding new flavours as the year goes on.”  Vaping Supplies are a small but important part of the well-known YESCiGS and ESTORES UK Ltd group, offering a premium supply of vaping products to e-cig users across the nation.

GSU tobacco ban beginning Aug. 1 - Motor E magazine 
.W 
Editor’s note: The original article stated that the ban was beginning one month ahead of time. That has been corrected to two months.  Georgia Southern University is set to become a tobacco-free campus effective August 1 and changes are already in place to transition campus into a tobacco-free zone, starting with the removal of ash urns.  In a letter from Brooks Keel, president of GSU, he explains that this decision is based on a recommendation from the Georgia Southern Tobacco-Free committee and approval from the President’s Cabinet.  The original date of the ban was set for October 1, a date handed down from the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia this past March when the board voted on the tobacco ban policy.  Beginning two months ahead of the enforcement date, the tobacco ban prohibits all and any use of tobacco products anywhere on land leased or owned GSU, including public spaces, cars and buildings.  “We all know that change is not always easy, but this University System of Georgia policy change reinforces our commitment to preserving and improving the health and comfort of our students, faculty, staff and guests,” Keel said in his letter.  Keel called tobacco and non-tobacco users to share the responsibility of this ban together and listed resources for students and faculty who are tobacco users, such as tobacco cessation classes and links to American Cancer Society and Georgia Department of Community Health.

Duterte agrees to certify bill on higher cigarette, alcohol tax as urgent 
.W 
Welcome to Rappler, a social news network where stories inspire community engagement and digitally fuelled actions for social change. Rappler comes from the root words "rap" (to discuss) + "ripple" (to make waves). SIN TAX. Lawmakers wants to increase the taxes imposed on tobacco and alcoholic drinks MANILA, Philippines – President Rodrigo Duterte agreed to certify as urgent the bill of Senator Manny Pacquiao increasing tobacco tax to P60 per pack, from the current P30. Duterte approved the recommendation of the Department of Health (DOH) and the Department of Finance (DOF) to back Pacquiao's bill, which he filed in October 2017. Senate Bill Number 1599, seeking to amend Republic Act 10351 or the Sin Tax Reform Act of 2012, increases the current unitary excise tax rate to P60 per pack from P30 per pack, and the annual excise tax to 9% from 4%. "The recommendation of the Department of Finance and the Department of Health is that this bill should be certified as urgent because, under the proposal, the tax on tobacco would be raised to P60 per pack, while on the part of alcohol it will be P40 per liter, so the recommendation is that that bill should be passed and signed into law," said Presidential Spokesman Salvador Panelo on Tuesday, January 8. On Monday night, Duterte presided over the first Cabinet meeting of 2019, during which he approved the DOH and DOF recommendation on Pacquiao's bill. But back in October 2018, Health Secretary Francisco Duque, in a letter to Duterte, had backed another Senate version of the bill, Senate Bill Number 1605, which seeks to impose a tax of P90 per pack, not P60 per pack. "This is a key public health measure to reduce deaths and disabilities due to tobacco and alcohol consumption, and, at the same time, a revenue measure to fund the universal health care program," Panelo said in a statement. Pacquiao, after filing his bill, had said that the higher tobacco and alcohol tax could generate some P60 billion to P70 billion in revenue for the government. The DOH previously said about P257 billion was needed for the first year of the universal health care program's implementation. The Senate and House were able to reconcile their versions of the universal health care (UHC) bill last November. Duterte has yet to sign it into law. The UHC bill seeks to automatically enroll all Filipinos in the proposed National Health Insurance Program. Meanwhile, bills for raising tobacco and alcohol taxes have been pending in the Senate since November 2017. In contrast, the House of Representatives passed its versions of a bill jacking up cigarette tax and a separate bill increasing tax on alcohol in December 2018. Whatever bill for higher tobacco and alcohol taxes will be passed into law will add to existing taxes imposed by the first tax reform package or the Train Law. – Rappler.com Would you like to share your vote?

Stoptober Quit Smoking Campaign Embraces e-Cigarettes – try vaping to help 
.W 
For the first time e-cigarettes are being encouraged in efforts to stop smoking. Â The annual Stoptober campaign in England is embracing the vaping form of smoking. Â This is seen as being the key to getting people to quit.  Until now health experts have tended to shy away from explicitly promoting e-cigarettes.  But the government campaign during October features vaping in its TV ad.  The guidance comes after e-cigarettes proved the most popular tool for quitting and done during last year’s campaign.  Some 53% of people used them. The e-cigarette helped push the numbers taking part in Stoptober since launch in 2012 to over 1.5 million.  E-cigarettes not yet officially prescribed on the NHS.  Vaping  However, doctors and other health professionals are encouraged to advise smokers vaping is a better alternative to smoking. That is if they want to use them.  New draft guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) does not list e-cigarettes. Â Not as a recommendation to help people quit. Â Although patients should be told that some smokers have found them helpful when they want to give up.  NICE advises that people who want to give up smoking need to know: Â there’s currently little evidence on the long-term benefits or harm of these products.  A successful attempt judged to be one where the person had tried to stop smoking in the past year and was still abstaining at the time of the survey.  The biggest rise in successful attempts to quit was among people from poorer backgrounds, who have traditionally been the least likely to give up.  Stats:  Latest figures suggest just over 15% of people were smoking in 2016. This down from 21% in 2007, when the smoking ban was introduced, and over 26% at the turn of the century.  As smoking has decreased, vaping has increased. About one in 20 people over 16 regularly uses e-cigarettes currently. A quarter of them are smokers or ex-smokers.  Meanwhile, NHS Health ScotlandÂ has stated for the first timeÂ that e-cigarettes are “definitely” less harmful than smoking tobacco.  All this is to get the numbers down. Â There are still too many people who smoke. Any advice or guidance that can be given to help is worth a try. Â The habit must end.

Work together to curb smoking 
.W 
What happens to your  body when you smoke? It has been proved that there is nothing healthy about smoking. Smoking is a serious illness that affects the smoker and those around him. Smoking destroys the lungs and reduces the amount of oxygen in your body’s cells and causes many other bad health effects such as cancer, pneumonia and early death.  We need more education about how smoking is dangerous. Experts and cancer survivors should do meetings in school and use social media like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter to share information. Cancer survivors can be invited to schools to talk to children about how bad smoking is. Also, the government can do many more things to stop people from smoking. For example, tobacco can be taxed more.  If we all stand for not smoking and educate young people about the dangers of smoking, everyone’s health will improve. This is too important for society to ignore.

Ombudsman bans vaping, smoking 
.W 
MANILA, Philippines – The Office of the Ombudsman has issued a directive banning vaping and smoking within its premises.  Ombudsman Conchita Carpio Morales signed on April 16 Office Circular No. 12, requiring the strict compliance with the smoking ban.  The ban covers all forms of tobacco products, including cigarettes, electronic-cigarettes or e-cigars and similar devices.  Morales included vaping in the list of smoking-related offenses that could result in a hefty fine as well as criminal and administrative cases against officials and employees who will not heed the policy.  A directive prohibiting smoking within the premises of the anti-graft agency has been in place since 2010 but it was not strictly followed, according to Morales.  “To ensure the success of the anti-smoking policy, smokers and non-smokers alike should be educated on the negative effects of smoking necessitating a need for the implementation of a smoking cessation program,” Morales said.  “Smoking refers to the act of lighting and or puffing any lighted cigarette, cigar, or any other form of tobacco product,” the ombudsman’s circular read.  E-cigarettes were not popular at the time when former Ombudsman Merceditas Gutierrez banned smoking within the anti-graft agency’s premises six years ago.  Users of e-cigarettes argued that vaping is not smoking because the end product is not inhaled but the vapor created by the vaporizing liquid.  Morales said she decided to issue a new anti-smoking policy since the previous one had not been strictly observed by ombudsman officials and employees.  She said the smoking ban in all government offices is in compliance with the Clean Air Act of 1999 and Tobacco Regulation Act of 2003.  Violators face fines of up to P10,000, Morales said.  The Civil Service Commission is also implementing smoke-free policy in government offices.  Morales ordered building administrators and supervisors to post no smoking signs and remove ashtrays and other cigarette receptacles within the vicinity of the Office of the Ombudsman.

Comment on Best Tobacco Flavored Vape Juices by Tim 
.W 
The best tobacco e-juice also has to be the most realistic tobacco e-liquid. Vapers looking for that distinctive tobacco flavor will settle for nothing less when it comes to tobacco-flavor e-liquid though many other characters enter into the mix. The tobacco in cigarettes does not have different flavor profiles. But tobacco e-liquid can and does have several flavor notes. Mixers do their best to extract a tobacco plant’s natural, earthy flavors – all the characteristics that are lost to combustion. They are also careful not to add artificial flavors so as not to change that authentic tobacco flavor.

They are a well-known e-cig company that also has a line of e-juices. This particular blend is exactly that: a blend of several different types of tobacco. From the fields of Virginia to the slopes of the Turkish steppe, the variety of flavors in this e-liquid will be evident from the first vape. Making the e-juice even more exotic and flavorful is the addition of Asian tobacco flavors. Pros: Cons: Chill’d Tobacco by Cosmic Fog is for users who want to enjoy the chill. Available in two sizes, this e-liquid offers a true tobacco flavor with added coolness. The VG/PG blend of 70/30 is perfect for all kinds of vapers.

Best Tobacco E-Juice Sample Pack #1 The Notebook by Black Note Virginia, Burley, Kentucky, Latakia Tobaccos, Cavendish and Menthol Blends Bottle Sizes: 6 x 10 ml Nicotine Strengths: 5 different nicotine levels (0, 3, 6, 12, 18 mg/ml) 50% PG 50% VG Flavor quality High Vapor production High Throat hit High Pros: A wide range of flavor profiles No artificial colors or flavors Superb throat hit Real tobacco flavor Cons: No high VG option Some e-juices may feel similar-tasting Black Note is a company dedicated to all-tobacco flavor e-juices. The Notebook is a collection of all their premium, small-batch e-juices. The package consists of six distinct e-liquids, each in a 10ml bottle, and with a 50/50 VG/PG. All the juices share some characteristics, such as being diacetyl-free. Black Note adds no artificial flavors or sweeteners to their juices. They aim to preserve all that authentic tobacco taste. Their tobacco plants span the globe, from the Italian Alps to the fields of Syria. The flavor profiles are also varied. Each e-juice, from Prelude (Virginia Tobacco) to Quartet (Latakia Tobacco) blends tastes as diverse as juniper, pepper, and menthol. Pros: Smooth flavor Real tobacco taste, without the harshness Amazing throat hit Good mix between flavor and cloud production Cons: Not much difference between tastes except Cool Menthol No other flavor profiles OFE Tobacco Lane showcases Old World flavors in four different e-juices. Vapers should expect nothing less from a company with a name like Old Fashioned Elixir (OFE). Their collection of classic, tobacco-inspired e-liquids do not pretend to be anything else. None of the four e-juices strays too far from authentic cigarette flavors. With names like Turkish Blend and Cool Menthol, no one will mistake these vape juices for a breakfast or dessert flavor. Despite their focus on tobacco-flavor, the e-juices carry bold, exotic notes that offer a crispness unmatched by any other e-juice maker. Nicotine ranges for each e-juice runs from 0mg to 12mg. Bottle sizes can be either 30 or 60ml, and the PG/VG ratios are an even 50/50. Pros: Smooth tobacco flavor Mellow throat hit Good for mouth-to-lung vaping Pod mods compatible Cons: No other flavor profiles Only one bottle size The NKD 100 American Patriots nic salt e-juice is a celebration of rich tobacco flavor. The high nicotine content does not overpower but delivers subtle tobacco notes. The unique nicotine salt formula of this e-juice offers a more nuanced character than freebase nicotine. It mimics all the bold, full-bodied taste of real smoke, but in a 50/50 PG/VG ratio that barely scratches the throat. The mouth-to-lung experience of this e-juice, especially when vaped in a pod mod device is second to none. American Patriots comes in a single bottle size, 30ml. Vapers can choose between two nicotine strengths 35mg and 50mg. Best Tobacco E-Juice of 2020: Winners and Prices Conclusion On the contrary, we are assuming that those who are accustomed to real tobacco cigarettes are more of the high-PG blends since these e-liquids deliver stronger flavor and throat hit, just like pure and analog tobaccos. We assessed each one’s quality, strength, smoothness, VG-PG blends, packaging, taste, and selection, and we have arrived at a list of the best tobacco-like vape juices today. Consider this our genuine assistance to those who want to quit smoking and switch to vaping, without letting go of that familiar tobacco taste.

Kansas City Scores Twin Win On Raising Smoking Age To 21 - KCUR 
.W 
Both Kansas City, Missouri, and Kansas City, Kansas, raised their legal smoking age to 21 on Thursday. Credit BigStock The governing bodies of both Kansas City, Missouri, and Kansas City, Kansas, voted Thursday to raise the legal age for buying tobacco and electronic nicotine-vapor products from 18 to 21 in their communities. Advocates have said studies indicate that as many as 95 percent of adult smokers say they started smoking prior to age 21.  They also have pointed to studies showing that 18-year-old smokers often become the “connection” for younger members of their high school social network, some as young as 14. The legal age increase proposals sailed through the Kansas City, Missouri City Council and the Board of Commissioners of the Unified Government of Wyandotte County/Kansas City, Kansas with only one “nay” vote on each of the two governing bodies. Both the Missouri and Kansas ordinances take effect before Dec. 1 and include fines for sellers, but not for underage buyers. Kansas City, Missouri, also added nicotine-vapor products to the list banned in enclosed public spaces, including bars and restaurants.

Statement from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., on new steps the agency is taking to support the development of novel nicotine replacement drug therapies to help smokers quit cigarettes 
.W 
Statement from FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., on new steps the agency is taking to support the development of novel nicotine replacement drug therapies to help smokers quit cigarettes SILVER SPRING, Md., Aug. 3, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- As a public health agency, there is no greater impact we can have to improve the health of our nation than to significantly reduce the rate of tobacco-related disease and death. Through the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's comprehensive framework for regulating nicotine and tobacco, we're developing policies that support the possibility of a world where combustible cigarettes could no longer create or sustain addiction. A key part of this framework are steps to pave the way for products that help currently addicted smokers move away from the deadliest form of nicotine delivery. Part of this work requires that we recognize that nicotine, while highly addictive, is delivered through products posing a continuum of risk â with combustible cigarettes at one end, to nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) products at the other. We're working on multiple fronts to recognize the role that more novel forms of nicotine delivery could play in achieving our public health goals, as part of an appropriately regulated marketplace. This not only includes encouraging innovation of potentially less harmful tobacco products for those adults who still seek to use nicotine (such as e-cigarettes), but also taking a closer look at our overall approach to the development and regulation of NRT products that are regulated as drugs, and designed to safely reduce withdrawal symptoms, including nicotine craving, associated with quitting smoking. The development of novel NRT products, regulated as new drugs, is a critical part of our overall strategy on nicotine. We know that about 70 percent of adult smokers in the U.S. want to quit. In fact, nearly half try to quit each year. But few succeed. Use of FDA-approved NRT products is generally considered to double the likelihood of a successful quit attempt (with variations between products). Our ultimate goal is to help more smokers completely quit cigarettes. But most of the existing NRTs â such as gums, patches and lozenges â have been approved for more than 20 years. With novel forms of nicotine delivery being developed, it's possible that new kinds of NRTs â with different characteristics or routes of delivery â can offer additional opportunities for smokers to quit combustible tobacco. We want to explore what new steps we can take using our regulatory policies to enable opportunities for innovation, while making sure these products are demonstrated to be safe and effective for their intended use. To achieve these goals, the Nicotine Steering Committee that we established last September has been evaluating new, evidence-based opportunities to advance therapeutic nicotine products for combustible tobacco product cessation. We have been examining the types of safety and efficacy studies that we suggest be conducted and the way that these products are used and labeled. This work to re-evaluate and modernize our framework aims to provide clarity for companies seeking to avail themselves of the pathway to market safe and effective smoking cessation products.Â Today, and as a result of this work, we're releasing the first of two draft guidances aimed at supporting the development of novel, inhaled nicotine replacement therapies that could be submitted to the FDA for approval as new drugs, similar to current over-the-counter pharmaceutical NRT products. The guidance, "Nonclinical Testing of Orally Inhaled Nicotine-Containing Drug Products," focuses on data recommended to evaluate potential toxicities associated with orally inhaled nicotine-containing drug products. This includes products such as electronic nicotine delivery systems like e-cigarettes that are intended for smoking cessation and other long-term uses that would make them subject to regulation as drugs. This is draft guidance. We're interested in public comment. We want to strike the right balance between enabling a viable, efficient path for these products to be regulated as drugs â where we have substantial tools to evaluate their safety and efficacy for their intended use as smoking cessation products. At the same time, we want to make sure we're asking sufficient questions about the long-term health effects of these inhaled products, especially their effect on the lungs, to ensure that they are safe for their intended use. This information will help FDA advance this new guidance. This draft guidance, when finalized, is aimed at providing sponsors with recommendations on the nonclinical information appropriate to support development and approval of orally inhaled nicotine-containing drug products. It recognizes that a great deal of toxicity information is available for nicotine. But such information may not be available for other compounds contained in e-liquids and delivered by these products. These include the flavorings and heat-generated chemicals. These products can be used for six months or more over the course of a lifetime. So, it's important to understand the risks to humans from these exposures, including developmental and reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity. We anticipate releasing the second draft guidance this fall. This second guidance will help lay out a framework for new potential clinically relevant outcomes for smoking cessation products, such as reducing the chance of a smoker going back to using cigarettes long term and showing a positive impact on certain measures of cardiovascular health. That future guidance also is expected to address potential alternative treatment regimens like pre-treatment before quit day, quitting by gradual reduction (reduce-to-quit), or using two NRT drug products together. These guidances are one part of larger policy efforts to address the public health crisis of tobacco usage in this country. Given some of these products are relatively new technologies, or innovations that haven't yet been through the product development and evaluation process, we'll be seeking input on these draft guidances and welcome feedback on whether we've struck the right balance between innovation and safety; and set the right framework to encourage companies to use the new drug pathway to bring novel NRT products to market, with our public health mission leading the charge. This work is aimed at creating a more flexible framework that enables the development of safe and effective product innovations that have the potential to be helpful in assisting smokers quit combustible cigarettes and improve their health. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation's food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.

Philip Morris in talks to reunite with Altria 
.W 
Marketplace has changed since companies split more than a decade ago as vaping and cannabis use rise Published on August 27, 2019. A Philip Morris Marlboro brand cigarette burns in an ashtray Credit: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg Philip Morris International, the maker of Marlboro cigarettes in overseas markets, is in talks to reunite with Altria Group more than 10 years after the tobacco giants split their operations. The deal would be the biggest since AT&T Inc. bid for Time Warner in 2016. Philip Morris had a market value of nearly $126.4 billion at the close of trading on Aug. 23, before speculation of a possible deal gained traction, while Altria was worth about $86.7 billion. The companies broke apart more than a decade ago, bowing to pressure from U.S. investors who wanted higher dividends and more share buybacks. The move was also pitched as a way to set free faster-growing overseas operations while the U.S. business was entangled in smoker lawsuits. But times have changed. Altria has recently diversified its portfolio with investments in vaping and cannabis, giving the company more growth potential even as fewer people smoke cigarettes. Some analysts and investors have argued that the companies should get back together, a move that would give Philip Morris more U.S. exposure. The transaction would give Philip Morris roughly 58% ownership of the new company, with Altria holding the rest, according to a person familiar with the terms who asked not to be identified because the details haven’t been made public. They are considering a no-premium deal based on the companies’ closing share prices on Aug. 23, according to the person. The companies would aim to close the deal within six months and expect to make no divestitures, the person said. Alternate products There’s been speculation that the companies might get back together. On Monday, Wells Fargo published a research note that said a deal could make sense now, in part because Altria has a stake in the vaping company Juul. A reunification would combine two of the most popular smoking alternative products: IQOS and Juul. Philip Morris has been plowing billions of dollars in promoting IQOS, a heat-not-burn product used by millions consumers outside the U.S.. Altria meanwhile has invested $12.8 billion in e-cigarette upstart Juul Labs Inc., which has catapulted itself to the U.S. industry leader in smoking alternatives in just a few years. Altria also has been planning to start selling IQOS in the U.S. this year, testing out demand in the Atlanta area with a store opening next month. Philip Morris said in a statement that no agreement has been formally reached and any deal would be subject to board, shareholder and regulatory approval. Altria also issued a statement confirming the talks. Like Hollywood, which has been churning out films based on blockbusters of decades past, Wall Street bankers seem to be running out of new ideas. Earlier this month, CBS Corp. agreed to reunite with Viacom Inc. in an $11.7 billion transaction, 13 years after the two media giants split. Analysts were largely positive on a potential tie-up between Altria and Philip Morris after speculation Monday afternoon that something was brewing. RBC Capital Markets analyst Nik Modi saw several strategic reasons for a deal, including geographic alignment with international competitors and full economic benefit of IQOS in the U.S. and global access for Juul. “The potential to reunite the companies has been often discussed, but we did not believe this would occur given the heavy regulatory burden in the U.S. market and its weakening growth profile,” Stifel analyst Chris Growe said in a note. “Perhaps the FDA’s approval of IQOS changed that thinking.” Antitrust concerns The tie-up would face little antitrust risk because the companies’ brands don’t compete in the same markets, said Kenneth Shea, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. That contrasts with the last major tobacco deal: Reynolds American Inc.’s 2015 takeover of Lorillard. The Federal Trade Commission, which reviews tobacco deals, required Reynolds to sell four brands to Imperial Tobacco Group to resolves antitrust concerns. One area of likely scrutiny would be the combined company’s control of the vaping market, said Shea, given Altria’s 35% stake in Juul and its agreement to sell IQOS in the U.S. for Philip Morris. “Depending on how regulators define the vapor market, there could be potential for perceived excessive control,” he said.

Eliminate the Risk of Secondhand Smoke to Your Family 
.W 
You don’t have to be a routine smoker to feel the harmful health effects that cigarette smoke produces. Keeping the windows open in the car or house doesn’t eliminate the risk, either.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that secondhand smoke exposure causes more than 41,000 deaths from heart disease and lung cancer among non-smoking adults each year. Secondhand smoke contains more than 7,000 chemicals, including 70 that have been linked to cancer.  Young children are most affected by secondhand smoke. This is especially true for children that live in a household where one or both parents smoke cigarettes at home. Common symptoms seen in children who are exposed to secondhand smoke include ear infections, severe asthma attacks and respiratory problems.  Keep in mind that there’s no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke. The best way to protect yourself is to not allow smoking in your home, car or anywhere you and your family live, work and play. Talk with friends and family members who are thinking about quitting. Your support can make the difference in their attempts to quit.

Biden administration nicotine plan won’t achieve laudable goal (Editorial) 
.W 
Anyone who believes otherwise need only look back to Prohibition, our nation’s ill-fated effort in the 1920s to protect the citizenry from the demonic effects of intoxicating spirits. How’d that work out? Nonetheless, officials have repeatedly tried to control the citizens’ urges over the years, ignoring the lessons of history as they go. And there you’d have it -- problem solved, right? No more smokers. No more of the terrible health consequences of cigarette smoking. Yeah, right -- that would happen. Because making it impossible for folks who are addicted to nicotine -- or who simply enjoy the effects of the highly addictive drug -- aren’t going to be magically free from desiring their fix if the federal government has made it impossible to get it from legal, over-the-counter cigarettes. They’ll look elsewhere, perhaps even to more dangerous alternatives. Black market smokes. Nicotine-laced products made in fly-by-night facilities shy on safety regulations. Street corner nicotine dealers promising the real thing. The goal is understandable enough. In a perfect world, there’d be no one smoking cigarettes. The negative health consequences are so great -- smoking is linked to 480,000 preventable deaths annually -- that no one can defend smoking as a logical pursuit. But effectively barring it by diminishing the drug that smokers are administering to themselves with each drag will cause problems that are easily anticipated. News of the plan was widely reported by various media outlets on Monday as something that was under consideration by President Joe Biden’s administration. There was no official announcement, no response to queries from reporters who asked questions of the White House. It’s enough to make one think that the Biden administration got the news out intentionally to see how it would be perceived. In politics, this is called a “trial balloon.” Send it up, with no one’s name attached to it, and see if it can fly. This one should go nowhere. Except, perhaps, in the schemes of those who would like to see a thriving market of real, full-nicotine cigarettes that are legal in other nations being smuggled into the United States.

Indiana Convenience Stores Call Cigarette Tax Hike Proposal ‘Devastating’ 
.W 
Explore our Fuels Resource Center for everything you need to know about fuels — from the source that knows the subject best.  ​INDIANAPOLIS – Indiana convenience stores are fighting a proposed $1 per pack tax increase on cigarettes, WIBC-TV reports. The Indiana House introduced the tax hike as part of the budget process.  That hasn’t sat well with the Indiana Grocery and Convenience Store Association, which called the potential increase “devastating” to its members. Raising the Indiana cigarette tax a dollar would put the state on par with neighbors Michigan and Illinois, but 40 cents higher than Ohio.  Retailers predict a tax increase would hit them hard. Chuck Taylor of the Chuckles Convenience Store chain said his stores experienced an 18% decline in sales when the state jacked up cigarette taxes a decade ago. Circle K estimates it would lose $3 million annually in the wake of a higher tax. Gary Kuns, tobacco marketing director for Speedway, testified that Illinois generated less tax money when that state increased the cigarette tax by a dollar five years ago.  Health advocates are pushing hard for a higher cigarette tax as a way to curb smoking. In 2015, Indiana had a 20.6% smoking rate, ranking it as the 12th highest of all 50 states.

Quitting smoking is hard. FDA wants new nicotine-replacement therapies to help. 
.W 
Wednesday Nov 29, 2017 at 4:00 PM Laurie Mcginley - The Washington Post The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday it is taking new steps to encourage the development of innovative nicotine-replacement therapies to wean smokers off conventional cigarettes. In a blog post on the agency's website, three top officials said they want to ensure the FDA has the right policies to advance new products to help smokers. "Our goal is to enable greater use of safe and effective options to help those who are addicted to nicotine get the help they need to quit combustible cigarettes altogether," said the post, which was signed by FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research Director Janet Woodcock and Center for Tobacco Products Director Mitchell Zeller. The post said a new Nicotine Steering Committee made up of senior FDA officials will explore the agency's handling of smoking-cessation products. It said the agency will hold a hearing on Jan. 26 to get public input. Among the questions the committee will explore: Are there ways to improve on the current over-the-counter nicotine-replacement systems, or new strategies that might be more effective? And how should they be evaluated? The effort is part of the agency's new tobacco-regulatory regime announced by Gottlieb last summer. About 480,000 people die of tobacco-related causes in the United States every year. While nicotine hooks people, it doesn't kill them; the hazard is posed by thousands of other chemical substances in cigarettes, many of them carcinogenic. Current FDA nicotine-replacement therapies include over-the counter gums, patches and lozenges, and prescription nasal sprays and inhalers. Most of those have been on the market for more than two decades. The blog post points out that studies suggest using such products can double the chance of success among those trying to quit smoking. The therapies are designed to supply controlled amounts of nicotine to reduce cravings. The committee will consider which types of safety and efficacy studies should be required for nicotine-replacement therapies as well as other issues. Those could include "changes to the labeling and indications for existing products or a new product that might deliver nicotine at different rates, or through different delivery mechanisms," the post said. For example, some e-cigarettes or other types of electronic nicotine delivery systems might be candidates for regulation as over-the-counter nicotine-replacement therapies. But the FDA officials said they also see "additional opportunities" for new and improved OTC products that could help smokers quit. In July, Gottlieb unveiled a new framework for tobacco that was designed to put nicotine at the center of the agency's regulatory effort. As part of the plan, he said, the FDA would require reductions in nicotine in conventional cigarettes to make them minimally addictive or nonaddictive. He stressed at the time that people who are addicted to nicotine would need alternative ways to get the drug if they are to successfully give up regular cigarettes. To make sure e-cigarettes are readily accessible, he delayed for several years a requirement that e-cigarettes marketed after February 2007 submit to a stringent FDA review. About 70 percent of adult smokers in the United States say they want to quit, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and more than half try to do so each year.

Campaign to raise California cigarette tax gets signatures to make ballot 
.W 
A well-financed campaign backed by billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer, medical groups and organized labor said Monday that it collected more than 1 million signatures for a ballot measure to raise California's cigarette tax by $2 a pack.Steyer and other leaders of the Save Lives California coalition delivered boxes of petitions to the San Diego County of Registrar of Voters office and will do the same at county offices throughout the state in coming days in its bid to raise the tax to $2.87 a pack.If 585,407 signatures are verified, the proposed state constitutional amendment would appear on an increasingly crowded Nov. 8 ballot alongside proposals to overturn a ban on single-use plastic bags at grocery stores and require actors to use condoms in adult films.The announcement came less than a month after Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown signed legislation to make California the second state in the nation, following Hawaii, to raise the legal age to buy tobacco from 18 to 21. Beginning June 9, it will be a crime to sell or give tobacco to anyone under 21 - except military personnel.The tax increase would apply to electronic cigarettes and other products with tobacco or nicotine. The measure calls for proceeds to be spent on Medi-Cal - the state's version of Medicaid - along with anti-smoking campaigns and medical research.Steyer, a former hedge fund manager who has contributed $1 million, said at a news conference that the campaign is personal because his mother had a three-pack-a-day habit and died of lung cancer 14 years ago."I think everybody in California has a family member, a close friend, whose lives have been tragically affected by tobacco ... This is going to make smokers pay their fair share," he said.The increase would make California's cigarette tax the ninth-highest in the nation, according to the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, an advocacy group. New York has the nation's highest state tax at $4.35 a pack, and Virginia is lowest at 30 cents.The weighted average cost for pack of cigarettes is $5.96 nationwide. The highest combined state-local tax rate is $6.16 in Chicago, with New York City second at $5.85 per pack.The average per-pack cost in California, which prohibits local cigarette taxes, is about $5.50, said Debra Kelley, advocacy director of the American Lung Association. The $2-a-pack increase would raise that to about $7.50 if cigarette makers pass along the full amount to consumers.David Sutton, a spokesman for tobacco company Altria Group Inc., said it opposes large targeted tobacco and e-vapor taxes. Altria is reviewing the California initiative and considering its options, he said.The American Vaping Association said it would work to defeat the measure but was undecided how much it would spend."Public health benefits every time a smoker switches to vaping," said George Conley, the group's president. "By recklessly campaigning to equate the taxes on deadly cigarettes with smoke-free vapor products, it is clearer than ever that so called 'anti-smoking' activists have officially gone off the rails."Backers of the tax increase contend that vaping lures young people to smoking tobacco.The tobacco tax campaign reported this month that it spent $2.8 million during the first three months of the year and had more than $4 million in cash on hand. Major backers include the California Medical Association, California Association of Hospitals and Health Systems, and the Service Employees International Union.Seven measures have collected enough signatures to qualify for the November ballot in the state, and an eighth - placed by the Legislature - would repeal prohibitions on multilingual instruction in public schools.The tobacco tax joins four other measures, including a proposal to legalize recreational use of marijuana, that are pending signature verification.

World No Tobacco Day: FDA sustains anti-tobacco education in schools, public places 
.W 
The Food and Drugs Authority (FDA), as part of this year’s World No-Tobacco Day-2021 (WNTD) celebration, is intensifying its anti-tobacco smoking public education campaign in schools, marketplaces and transport terminals. The education aims to sensitise the public on the need to quit smoking and the associated health benefits of not smoking. The year-long campaign, under the theme, ‘Commit to quit’, according to the FDA, would advocate for strong tobacco cessation policies, promote increased access to cessation services, raise awareness of tobacco industry tactics and empower tobacco users to make successful attempts to quit smoking through ‘quit and win initiatives’. Though more than 804,000 adults in Ghana are estimated to smoke cigarettes and other tobacco products on a daily basis, the Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS, 2017) has estimated that the incident is prevalent among young people in the country. The GYTS Ghana Fact Sheet indicates that 8.8 percent of boys and 8.1 per cent of girls, currently use tobacco products whiles the use of shisha is sharply rising among young people in Ghana. Every year, tobacco kills more than eight million people globally, with almost seven million of these deaths emanating directly from tobacco use, with around 1.2 million people dying due to exposure to second-hand smoke from smokers. Smokers are exposed to a lethal mixture of more than 7000 toxic chemicals including at least 70 known carcinogens that can damage nearly every organ in the human body. Instructively, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that smoking causes over $500 billion in economic damage each year. The Head of Tobacco and Substances of Abuse Department of the FDA, Dr Mrs Olivia Boateng speaking on the need for smokers to quit, said the COVID-19 pandemic has even presented a higher risk to smokers as the hand to mouth contact during smoking and sharing of mouth pieces of shisha tubes could easily aid the spread of the virus. Dr Boateng explained that a review of studies by public health experts convened by WHO on April 29, 2020 confirmed the higher risk of smokers to COVID-19 complications alongside other respiratory diseases. The complications are a result of the compromised lung function arising from continuous exposure to tobacco toxins. Giving details of data on smokers, she said the 804,000 daily cigarette smokers figure, was estimated by the Tobacco Atlas Ghana (2015) and that it included more than 425,200 men, 69,200 women and 2,700 boys. About 75 men in Ghana die every week from cigarettes smoking. To this end, the FDA seeks to promote the benefits of quitting tobacco. These benefits are enormous and kick in almost immediately. For instance, 20 minutes of quitting smoking leads to a drop in heart rate. Within 12 hours, the carbon monoxide level in a smoker’s blood drops to normal and within 2-12 weeks, blood circulation improves with a corresponding increase in lung function. Furthermore, in a spate of 1-9 months, coughing and shortness of breath decreases, and within 5-15 years, the stroke risk of the smoker is reduced to that of a non-smoker. Also, within a matter of 15 years, the risk of heart disease drops to normal levels as that of a non-smoker. The Authority has also referred smokers to various health facilities across the country to obtain counselling and cessation services. These facilities include the Addictive disease Centre at the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital, Accra Psychiatric Hospital, Pantang Psychiatric Hospital, Ankaful Psychiatric Hospital, Valley View Clinic, Adom Clinic (Kumasi), Sunyani Regional Hospital, Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital and the Ho Teaching Hospital. Meanwhile, Chief Executive of the FDA, Mrs Delese Mimi Darko has explained that the continuous enforcement of the comprehensive smoke free policies such as the ban on tobacco advertisement, fees on tobacco product importation, ban on public smoking and the corresponding introduction of punitive fines have helped to reduce the prevalence of tobacco use in Ghana.

National No Smoking Day: How to quit fags in ONE hour with a treatment that really works 
.W 
Today is National No Smoking Day, a day when thousands of people around the country will resolve to quit smoking. In the UK alone, there's around 10million smokers but around two thirds of them want to give up the unhealthy habit.  While there are various methods out there to help cigarette-addicts quit, from nictotine replacement therapy to going cold turkey, studies have shown that hypnotherapy could be the best way to give up for good.  Like many other people, I was sceptical that any kind of quick fix could help me ditch cigarettes. But I decided to go for a hypnosis session to see if the treatment could cure my addiction in 60 minutes. I went to see celebrity hypnotherapist Susan Hepburn – who counts Adele and Lily Allen as her clients – at her Harley Street clinic after trying and failing to go cold turkey on my own.  When I got there, Susan asked if I had any cigarettes on me and told me to put the pack on the table next to me. After a chat about my life and habit, I got comfy in the reclining hypnotherapy chair and closed my eyes. Susan warned me that it wouldn’t feel like anything was happening and it didn’t, I just sat back and listened to her voice.  I didn’t even realise I was in a “hypnotic state” but apparently the clues are slow breathing, rapid eye movement and a relaxed jaw. Once the session had ended, it’s safe to say I didn’t really feel any different, but I walked out leaving the pack of fags on her table. When I thought about smoking, I knew I could easily light up but at the same time didn’t feel like I needed to and the cravings were gone.

Vape shops sue to block U.S. regulation covering e-cigarettes 
.W 
Search Our Site Vape shops sue to block U.S. regulation covering e-cigarettes Tuesday, January 30, 2018 1:52 p.m. EST E-cigarettes are displayed at 'smoke-not-smoke' at Camden in London June 9, 2013. REUTERS/Toby Melville By Nate Raymond (Reuters) - A group of vape shops in five U.S. states on Tuesday announced a trio of lawsuits challenging a rule adopted by the Food and Drug Administration that allows the regulator to treat e-cigarettes and similar devices like cigarettes. The vape shops, represented by the Pacific Legal Foundation conservative legal group, in lawsuits filed in federal courts in Texas, Minnesota and Washington, D.C., argued the 2016 rule was unconstitutional. The shops located in California, Michigan, Minnesota, North Dakota, and Texas argue that the so-called "Deeming Rule" that deems e-cigarettes to be tobacco products was not legally adopted because it was issued by a career FDA employee, rather than an officer appointed by the president. The lawsuits also contend that the rule violates the U.S. Constitution's free speech protections by requiring vape retailers to obtain the FDA's approval before advertising information about their products' health and related effects. "These regulations don't just harm small businesses and consumers, they undermine constitutional safeguards for individual liberty," Thomas Berry, a lawyer with Pacific Legal Foundation, said in a statement. The FDA declined to comment. The lawsuits come amid legal and legislative efforts by tobacco and vaping companies to derail the FDA rule, which was adopted during Democratic President Barack Obama's administration. In 2009, Congress passed a law allowing the FDA to extend its oversight to all tobacco products. The 2016 rule brought e-cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco and hookah tobacco in line with existing rules for cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. As a result, companies are now required to submit e-cigarettes and other newer tobacco products for government approval, list their ingredients and place health warnings on packages and in advertisements. E-cigarettes heat nicotine-laced liquid into vapor but do not contain tobacco. Big tobacco companies such as Altria Group Inc see vaping products as a promising business line and have lobbied alongside their smaller e-cigarette counterparts against the rule. The vape shops that filed the lawsuits announced on Tuesday contend that they were being subjected to burdensome rules that had hurt their ability to attract customers and restricted how that could advertise their businesses.

Mississippi teen cigarette use at new low but e-cigs now popular 
.W 
Mississippi teens aren't smoking cigarettes as much as years past. The latest data shows cigarette use at a new low. But that decrease in tobacco use does not necessarily mean teens are not using nicotine.  The latest survey shows more middle and high schoolers using e-cigarettes instead of cigarettes or smokeless tobacco. 12%of high schoolers and 4.6% in middle school admitted to using e-cigs.    "The 7000 flavors that you can get, it doesn't cover up the fact that there still nicotine in the product," said Langston Moore with The Partnership for a Healthy Mississippi. "E-cigarettes contain nicotine. Nicotine is addictive. Nicotine can affect your brain just like heroin or cocaine. It's a dangerous product."    The Partnership for a Healthy Mississippi says e-cigs are the latest challenge in the fight for tobacco prevention. There are prevention programs like RAT (Reject All Tobacco) and Generation Free, a youth led initiative. Both are kept going through grant money from the Department of Health.    "The e-cigarette usage of middle schools has gone down about almost 2.1% in a year," said Moore. "We're reaching the kids with messages just like we do there to back her about the dangers and the effects of e-cigarettes."    The State Health Department noted this when discussing e-cigs, just because teens think it's safer doesn't mean it's safe.

US vows again to ban menthol flavor in cigarettes, cigars 
.W 
Posted: Apr 29, 2021 / 08:59 AM CDT / Updated: Apr 29, 2021 / 04:55 PM CDT FILE – This May 17, 2018 file photo shows packs of menthol cigarettes and other tobacco products at a store in San Francisco. U.S. health regulators will announce a new effort Thursday, April 29, 2021, to ban menthol cigarettes, according to an Biden administration official. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. health regulators pledged again Thursday to try to ban menthol cigarettes, this time under pressure from African American groups to remove the mint flavor popular among Black smokers. The Food and Drug Administration has attempted several times to get rid of menthol but faced pushback from Big Tobacco, members of Congress and competing political interests in both the Obama and Trump administrations. Any menthol ban will take years to implement and will likely face legal challenges from tobacco companies. Thursday’s announcement is the result of a lawsuit filed by anti-smoking and medical groups last summer to force the FDA to finally make a decision on menthol, alleging that regulators had “unreasonably delayed” responding to a 2013 petition seeking to ban the flavor. The deadline for the agency’s response was Thursday. The FDA said it aims to propose regulations banning the flavor in the coming year and declined to speculate on when the rule would be finalized. The action would also ban menthol and fruity flavors from low-cost, small cigars, which are increasingly popular with young people, especially Black teens. “We will save save hundreds of thousands of lives and prevent future generations from becoming addicted smokers,” said Dr. Janet Woodcock, the FDA’s acting commissioner. She cited research estimates that banning menthol would prevent 630,000 tobacco-related deaths over 40 years, more than a third of them among African Americans. Menthol is the only cigarette flavor that was not banned under the 2009 law that gave the FDA authority over tobacco products, an exemption negotiated by industry lobbyists. The act did, though, instruct the agency to continue to weigh banning menthol. The flavor’s persistence has infuriated anti-smoking advocates, who point to research that menthol’s numbing effect masks the harshness of smoking, likely making it easier to start and harder to quit. The mint-flavored cigarettes are overwhelmingly used by young people and minorities, particularly Black smokers, 85% of whom smoke menthols. That compares to about a third of white smokers. “The science is there, the data is there, so why are these products still on the market?” said Carol McGruder of the African American Tobacco Control Leadership Council. Her group sued along with Action on Smoking and Health, the American Medical Association and the National Medical Association, which represents Black physicians. After the FDA announcement the groups promised to keep pushing for swift implementation: “this is not the end of this fight, only the next stage.” For decades, companies focused menthol marketing and promotions on Black communities, including sponsoring music festivals and neighborhood events. Company documents released via 1990s litigation also show companies viewed menthol cigarettes as good “starter” products because they were more palatable for teenagers . “There was a specific, intentional focus on creating the next generation of smokers by making menthol cigarettes available in those communities,” said Dr. Nia Heard-Garris, who chairs the American Academy of Pediatrics’ group on minority health and equity. In the late 1990s, new restrictions banned cigarette advertising from billboards, public transit and most event sponsorships. Companies shifted more promotions to retail locations like gas stations and convenience stores, which researchers have shown are heavily concentrated in Black neighborhoods About a third of all cigarettes sold in the U.S. are menthol and its elimination would be a huge blow to tobacco companies, including Altria and Reynolds American, maker of the leading menthol brands, Newport and Kool. With the slow decline of smoking, tobacco companies have been diversifying into alternative products, including electronic cigarettes and tobacco pouches. But those ventures still account for a tiny slice of industry sales. A spokeswoman for Reynolds American said the company would submit evidence countering FDA’s proposal. “Published science does not support regulating menthol cigarettes differently from non-menthol,” she said in a statement. An Altria spokesman said in a statement that “criminalizing menthol” would have “serious unintended consequences.” The FDA stressed Thursday that its ban would only apply to manufacturers, distributors and retailers, not individuals. Smoking can cause cancer, strokes and heart attacks and is blamed for 480,000 deaths each year in the U.S. About 14% of Americans smoke cigarettes, with rates roughly even between white and Black populations. But Black smokers are less likely to successfully quit, a trend that the U.S. Surgeon General and others have attributed to menthol cigarettes. Menthol occurs naturally in mint plants. Known for its cooling effect, the chemical is used in cough drops and other medicines. Cigarette makers began adding the chemical in the 1920s after realizing it reduced the throat hit of cigarettes. Past government efforts targeting menthol have faced opposition from lawmakers from traditional tobacco states like North Carolina, but also some members of the Congressional Black Caucus, many who have received campaign contributions from cigarette makers. Some caucus members warned that banning menthol would create an illegal market for the products, subjecting Black communities to increased law enforcement. But calls for action have been growing and last year the House of Representatives voted to ban the flavor with support from the majority of Black members. The bill stalled in the Republican-controlled Senate after President Donald Trump made clear he opposed the measure. The FDA’s attempts to get rid of menthol have repeatedly been delayed or derailed by forces inside and outside government. In 2011, an outside panel of FDA advisers recommended banning menthol after concluding that it increases smoking among young people and minorities and makes it harder for them to quit. But cigarette makers challenged the findings in court, claiming some panel members had conflicts of interest they hadn’t disclosed. In 2013, the FDA conducted its own internal study and reached similar conclusions, but the Obama administration did not move ahead with a ban. Under the Trump administration, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb tried to again restart the process but it was never greenlighted by the White House. Massachusetts and California have passed laws banning menthol. But California’s ban was suspended in January after a legal challenge backed by tobacco companies; the issue is on the ballot next year. ___ Follow Matthew Perrone on Twitter: @AP_FDAwriter ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

Swedish Snus: A Less Risky Alternative 
.W 
Swedish Match, the world’s leading manufacturer of Swedish snus, applied to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for a reduced harm warning label for their product; however an FDA advisory panel recommended rejecting the application late last week. The current label states that snus causes gum disease, mouth cancer and tooth loss and is addictive. Swedish Match’s requested labeling reads – Warning: No tobacco product is safe, but this product presents substantially lower risks to health than cigarettes. Swedish Match is amenable to including language referencing snus’ addictive properties. While the FDA is not obligated to follow the panel’s recommendation, it typically does.  Swedish Match’s modified risk tobacco product application is the first accepted for consideration by the FDA. Manufacturers must meet two criteria in order to qualify.  Swedish snus meets both of these criteria. It is a significantly less risky alternative to traditional tobacco products and has a proven track record as an effective smoking cessation tool.  Swedish snus, not to be confused with other oral tobacco products like chewing tobacco and American snuff, is a moist, smokeless tobacco that comes in small, teabag-like pouches that are placed beneath the upper lip. Because of the way Swedish snus is pasteurized, it has very low levels of nitrosamine– the naturally occurring carcinogenic compounds in tobacco.  The European Union (EU) Commission’s Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) has conducted exhaustive studies on the health risks and smoking cessation benefits associated with Swedish snus. Findings include:  Because Sweden is the only EU member nation where snus is manufactured and sold legally, Sweden and non-EU member Norway offer insights into Swedish snus’ potential risks and benefits. Snus was commonly used in Sweden but was supplanted by cigarettes after World War I. Swedish snus consumption rose dramatically in the 1970s because of health concerns over cigarette smoking, appearing to spur a reduction in cigarette use and leading to a decrease in smoking and tobacco-related diseases including lung and oral cancer. Between 1980 and 2011, the number of Swedish males who are daily smokers dropped from 35.1 percent to 12.7 percent; significantly lower than the EU’s average male smoking rate of 29 percent. At the same time, the number of daily male snus users in Sweden climbed to 19 percent. According to a National Institutes of Health (NIH) report on Swedish twins, “Snus use was the strongest independent correlate of smoking cessation,” suggesting that using snus helped Swedes to quit smoking.  Norway’s experience has mirrored Sweden’s. According to Karl Lund, Research Director at the Norwegian Institute for Alcohol and Drug Research, increased snus use has led to a drop in smoking from 37 percent in 1985 to 15 percent in 2013 among those aged 16-74. The UK’s Royal College of Physicians reported that, “in relation to cigarette smoking, the hazard profile of the lower-risk smokeless product is very favourable.”  Product labeling should provide consumers with accurate information to make informed purchasing decisions. Warning labels are appropriate for risky products. However, information about a product’s risk reduction properties also helps the public to make solid choices. While the EU has not lifted its Swedish snus ban, it has altered snus warning labels to read, “Snus can damage your health and is addictive.” Swedish Match has applied for similar wording from the FDA, which seems a reasonable request as Swedish snus is a significantly less risky alternative to traditional tobacco products and can aid with smoking cessation. The American people have a right to know both the risks and benefits associated with the products they buy.

Thirty-Year, Pack-A-Day Smoker Quitting Using E-Cigs 
.W 
Follow below the squiggly thing for a brief history of my attempts to quit smoking...the methods I have tried, the amount of success I had, and my own feelings about the reasons why each of these previous attempts failed.  Over the years, I have tried, numerous times, to quit - and been unsuccessful every time...the longest I had ever gone without smoking was just over two weeks.  Even when I got my Gender Reassignment Surgery, and was warned to quit smoking for six weeks after the surgery, I found myself unable to comply with this directive, and resumed smoking a week after the surgery - even with the knowledge that any complications of my surgery would be blamed on my smoking.  This takes on additional significance when you understand I had my surgery halfway around the world, in Bangkok, Thailand, where there is no recourse for medical malpractice.  I have been a regular pack-a-day smoker since I was fourteen.  This is now thirty years.  This makes me what medical professionals would call a thirty pack-year smoker.  If I had been two packs a day for that time, I'd be considered a sixty pack-year smoker.  This is how medical professionals describe how long, and how much a smoker has been smoking.  Forgive my indulgence there, but, god...the satisfaction of inhaling and exhaling....is just UNDESCRIBABLE!!  For those of you who never smoked, I certainly don't mean to encourage smoking.  But you also have NO IDEA...the amount of sheer pleasure and satisfaction a smoker gets from the feel of holding a cigarette, from taking that drag....the flavor, and the exhale!  You simply have no idea the level of satisfaction a smoker gets from this.  And it is precisely for this reason - that all conventional methods of quitting smoking failed to provide this satisfaction - why all those attempts also failed, and failed miserably...within two weeks.  I tried quitting cold turkey.  This was the absolute worst, and the least successful method I ever tried.  This attempt was made in 2002, when I was in Bangkok, Thailand.  I lasted a week.  I had been, as I mentioned, advised to quit smoking for at least six weeks after the surgery.  I was advised that not quitting would complicate my recovery, and could lead to serious problems.  I still failed.  Threats from medical professionals - just don't help.  They are not a sufficient motivator for me.  And they certainly do not replace the satisfaction of smoking.  I tried the patch, I tried the gum.  None of them worked for more than a week to two weeks.  The gum generally didn't taste very good...and you weren't even supposed to actually CHEW it...just bite into it and then hold it in your mouth.  The patches always wanted to come off with the first sweat.  And neither provided the things I found enjoyable about smoking.  I tried regular gum.  Wrigley's Spearmint, to be exact.  This was the most-successful method of quitting I had tried prior to my most recent ongoing attempt, which I will get into in a few moments.  I lasted almost two and a half weeks on the Wrigley's Spearmint.  It at least provided a pleasant taste, a taste similar to the Menthol cigarettes I had been smoking.  But in the end, it wasn't enough.  I even tried not smoking indoors, even at home....failed.  I tried putting hard candy into all my ashtrays.  No biggie, just got me an empty Coke can, and used that as an ashtray!  The only thing I never tried was drugs.  Things like CHANTIX would not be a good option for me, given my history of depression.  There is also a potential side effect to CHANTIX, which makes it an option I would never consider:  Vivid and/or unusual dreams.  I had taken meds for my depression before, and the exact med I was taking produced this specific side effect.  I would wake up in the middle of the night, too terified to move...to even turn on the light over my bed - with my heart racing, and bathed in cold sweat.  I took myself off that medication and called my doctor, demanding something else, telling him I was not going to go through what I was going through anymore...it was worse than the original condition for which the medication had been prescribed.  I also tried early versions of E-cigarettes...the kind with a "cartomizer" that you changed out every day or two.  They didn't work for me, because you could never get a decent drag on them...and they tasted filthy.  The kind I am talking about here are the kind that really look like a cigarette...and the tip even glows when you drag on it.  Did not work for me.  Utterly failed to deliver the kind of satisfaction I needed.  Recently, I moved to North Carolina.  I was happy about one aspect of the move right off....CHEAP CIGARETTES!!  Cigarettes are twenty bucks cheaper a carton here than in Pennsylvania, where I had moved from.  Prices in Massachusetts are just insane...over nine bucks a pack.  Yet I broke down and bought some, even in Massachusetts, when on a trip up there recently, I had not brought along enough cigarettes to last my trip.  So higher and higher prices were no motivation for me to quit, either.  I still remember buying cigarettes for my dad, when I was a kid.  They were 55 cents a pack then, and a kid could buy them from stores, with a signed note from the adult parent.  One could also get them from vending machines.  I remember when they first went over a buck a pack...and how folks all around me would say that they would quit if smokes went over two bucks a pack.  They did.  And those same people did not quit.  When I began smoking, they were just under $2.50 a pack.  Now, I could pay about five bucks a pack here in North Carolina...or nearly seven dollars a pack in Pennsylvania.  My move to North Carolina happened to introduce me to a method of quitting smoking that I have found which may actually work!  At the very least, it provides me with everything I enjoy about smoking (and some side benefits outside of the health issues)  I attended a local "Harvest Festival" in my new town, Wendell, NC about a week after moving here.  And there I happened upon a vendor selling a new kind of e-cigarette I had never seen before.  This device did not have a "cartomizer" it had a tank you filled with liquid...and many flavors to choose from.  I knew immediately I had found the sort of thing that JUST MIGHT be successful.  Yet, controversy swirls among health agencies and health professionals concerning the effectiveness of "vaping" as a method of quitting or reducing smoking.  Certainly, "vaping" is probably not as healthy as not smoking or vaping at all...but, if the choice is between smoking conventional cigarettes versus "vaping" I cannot see how "vaping" is not the better choice.  Certainly it cannot POSSIBLY be more harmful, and, in the time I have been vaping, I have noticed certain health benefits from quitting conventional cigarettes....even though I have replaced them with vaping.  That, right there, I think is the main reason why "vaping" has been looked upon by many health professionals, and health organizations as not beneficial to quitting smoking.  They have a vested interest in continuing to sell us "stop smoking" products that do not satisfy, and therefore, do not work.  There are, also, those who believe that the variety of flavors might entice young people to take up vaping...which could then lead to them smoking conventional cigarettes.  (Link)  I disagree.  First of all, conventional cigarettes do NOT come in the flavors that would entice the young to take up vaping.  Secondly, when I first began vaping...I was weaning myself off conventional cigarettes.  I had five packs of conventional cigarettes...and they lasted me three weeks (normally, in the same time period I would have smoked just over two cartons) - and towards the end of that "wean-off" period...I began to discover that, to me, the conventional cigarette tasted dirty and filthy compared to vaping.  Thus I think it very unlikely anyone would choose to take up smoking as a replacement to vaping.  So...for those who do not really know what these e-cigarettes are (some call them hookah pipes, by the way, although, in reality, hookah pipes are different from e-cigarettes) This Wikipedia Article explains what e-cigarettes are and how they work.  Note that the e-cigarettes I had tried previously, and failed with...were so-called "first generation" devices.  What I use now is best described as a "second generation" device.  I'm not really handy and experienced enough to try some of the "third generation" devices now available.  I certainly do not mean to suggest that vaping is harmless, quite the contrary, there ARE potential harms and risks involved in vaping...many of those risks involve mishandling of the "e-liquid" that is used in second and third generation devices.  The controversy rages on, and one is given to wonder what interests each side has in the position they have taken on the subject of vaping.  But if I am to be an example, I am currently 24 days completely quit smoking - and that is longer quit than any other method I have ever tried.  So those who say there is not enough empirical evidence that they are beneficial to smokers who want to quit...they haven't talked to me...or to many of the people I have met in some of the local "vape lounges" who, like me, were long-term smokers who sought, for various reasons, a better alternative to smoking.  We Should Cheer E-Cigarettes, Not Condemn Them!!  Prior to my taking up vaping and quitting smoking...I used to have a half-hour-long coughing fit every morning on waking up...and again on first going to bed at night.  Since I have totally quit smoking and only vape...no more coughing fits!  Additionally, vaping gives me the satisfaction of handling a cigarette...of tasting the cigarette, and of inhaling and exhaling.  Not to mention, I have found that cinnamon-flavor vape is very nice!  I rotate between four flavors currently....Extreme Ice, Candy Cane, Cinnamon, and Menthol.  I get the satisfaction and the pleasures of smoking, without the over 7,000 harmful chemicals delivered by conventional cigarettes.  Also, I can adjust the level of nicotine I get in a number of ways...I can buy e-liquid in different strengths, I can adjust up or down the voltage - and these are things one cannot do with conventional cigarettes!  This gives me an opportunity to slowly wean myself off the nicotine entirely...which still enjoying the pleasures I associate with smoking.  They even make e-liquid which contains no nicotine whatsoever.  I cannot see myself giving up vaping, but, cutting down the nicotine level is something I will likely do.  Twenty-four days and counting.  My longest success rate in attempting quitting thus far.  Take that, Pennsylvania Medical Society!  Take that, WHO!!  Take that, UN Health Agency!  Now how can that be a bad thing?

E-cigs, apps and the FDA's push to limit nicotine 
.W 
Smoking cessation expert Dr. Jonathan Bricker weighs in on new studies and a federal effort to regulate an ‘astonishingly addictive’ drug  Aug. 1, 2017  |  By Diane Mapes / Fred Hutch News Service  FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb announced Friday that the agency plans to cut back on the level of nicotine in cigarettes. "We must do more to help Americans and their families lead healthier lives, and to avoid or break free from harmful cigarette addiction," he said. "The key lies in taking a new and comprehensive approach to the regulation of nicotine."  AFP file via Getty Images  Smoking is in the news again with a new study touting the usefulness of e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation tool and an announcement from the Food and Drug Administration regarding their plans to cut back on nicotine, an “astonishingly addictive” drug that keeps people hooked, usually from a young age.  The FDA’s move was announced Friday by its new commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who referred to nicotine and the smoke particles it attaches itself to as an “addictive chemical mix of disease and death.”  “We need to envision a world where cigarettes lose their addictive potential through reduced nicotine levels,” Gottlieb said of the FDA’s proposed plan. “Cigarettes will likely remain incredibly toxic, what with the presence of over 7,000 chemicals in cigarette smoke. But with a balanced regulatory approach, we may be able to reach a day when the most harmful products are no longer capable of addicting our kids.”  What does all this mean and what’s the science behind it? We turned to Dr. Jonathan Bricker, a psychologist and smoking cessation expert with Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center’s Public Health Sciences Division for answers. Bricker and his team have created a handful of tools, some of which rely on acceptance and commitment therapy, or ACT, to help smokers acknowledge, and eventually overcome, their cravings. Most recently, he’s teamed up with CVS Health Foundation to support cancer patients who want to kick their nicotine addiction.  Fred Hutch public health researcher Dr. Jonathan Bricker  Photo by Robert Hood / Fred Hutch News Service  First, let’s talk about the idea of reducing the amount of nicotine in cigarettes. Can the FDA do that? And would that also include limiting nicotine in e-cigs?  Yes, it is within the authority of the FDA to do this, through something known as the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, which was passed in 2009. That act allows the FDA to set standards for how much nicotine is in a cigarette.  The FDA is regulating the manufacture of e-cigarettes and vaping devices, as well, and regulating the nicotine content in those devices. That's separate from what they're doing with combustible cigarettes — there's a phase-in period of several years. But they are going to regulate the manufacture of e-cigarettes, which includes the nicotine content, the method of extracting the nicotine and they're also going to limit the marketing of flavors that we know appeal to children.  Going after the chemical that hooks people seems pretty logical. What do you think of the idea?  It’s a smart strategy. On a population level, a policy like this would serve two functions: It would help adult smokers quit because they’d be reducing their addiction level over time and it would keep young people from smoking and becoming addicted. It would prevent progression of smoking in youth and help reduce smoking addiction in adults. Those are very good things.  And it’s actually an old idea, proposed by some colleagues of mine back in 1994, that’s finally getting some traction. The FDA will seek input from scientists, from the public and from industry to determine how to shape the policy and ensure that it’s being properly implemented by the manufacturers. We won’t see it take shape for maybe three years.  Nonetheless, it’s a big deal that they’re reviewing it and taking this part of tobacco control science seriously enough to entertain and pursue it. It’s good news from that perspective.  It seems like good news. Why has it taken 23 years to get to this point?  The main reason we’ve had to wait is because of the tobacco industry. They have a lot of lobbyists and they have a lot of say and control, and there’s been industry resistance to this idea. As soon as the news came out that the FDA intended to seek input for a policy change, the stocks for tobacco products dropped. There’s a huge financial reason for Big Tobacco to resist this type of policy.  Is that the only reason?  No, the other reason is you have to figure out what level to reduce the amount of nicotine to and that’s an experimental question, a laboratory question. And the devil is in the details.  There’s not a consensus among the scientific community as to what the level should be. What it takes for one person to become addicted may be more nicotine than for another person. There are individual differences in our biology. If we’re going to do a massive change at a population level, we have to figure out what the level should be.  There have been some studies that suggest reducing it to about half a milligram provides less pleasure for smokers. But getting the number right is important.  Why not just take nicotine out of cigarettes completely?  You could, in concept, but the FDA does not have the authority to remove all nicotine from cigarettes. It’s a part of the law and the way it’s written. They cannot remove it completely. But the FDA does have the authority to lower the amount of nicotine in cigarettes. That’s where we are.  So how do they do it? Through genetic engineering? Or is it more like decaffeinating coffee?  You can genetically engineer the tobacco plants or chemically extract nicotine levels after the fact, just like they do with caffeine and coffee beans.  There are about 10 to 15 milligrams of nicotine in one cigarette. But the amount of nicotine that a smoker takes in when he or she smokes is about 1 to 2 milligrams per cigarette. If you can lower the content so that you get about a half milligram, then you can reduce the reinforcing qualities of nicotine, the level of pleasure you get from smoking that cigarette. It becomes less enjoyable and therefore less addicting.  They’re sort of putting a lock on the cigarette, limiting how much nicotine is in the cigarette to begin with.  But nicotine isn’t the only harmful thing in cigarettes? It's just the most addictive thing, correct?  Yes, they actually add other chemicals to make cigarettes more addictive. They add benzene and fluorine and chlorine and ammonia. When they are combined and they bind to the nicotine, cigarettes become much more addictive.  Big Tobacco’s goal is to get the nicotine to cross the blood-brain barrier more quickly. The quicker you cross this barrier, the more addictive the substance will be. Cigarette manufacturing is really a chemistry question: How do we manipulate this substance so it will cross the blood-brain barrier faster so people will use this product more than that product? It’s what differentiates the product — the flavor and how fast it crosses the blood-brain barrier.  Could those other chemicals still be added even if the nicotine levels are lowered?  Yes, they could. There’s a whole area of National Institutes of Health-funded research called tobacco regulatory science, and the purpose is to do these types of studies to help inform policy for questions just like this.  Should we also regulate how much ammonia is in cigarettes? I hope so. But it’s a chemistry question and that’s why tobacco regulatory science exists. It got started after the 2009 act.  The FDA is going to be listening very closely to see what scientists have learned about how the other additives interact. Scientists have become important stakeholders in influencing policy. Hopefully, the new director of the FDA will listen.  Speaking of science, a new studypublished Thursday in the British Medical Journal suggests e-cigarettes can help people quit traditional cigarettes. Or is that overstating it?  Unfortunately, the BMJ study is not conclusive because of the way it was designed. It’s a cross-sectional survey, and it’s looking at the quit rates for combustible tobacco products among people who used e-cigarettes versus those who haven’t used e-cigarettes. The study found the quit rate was higher in people who used e-cigs versus the people who did not.  But that’s just one conclusion. The other conclusion you could make is that the people they surveyed were going to quit combustible cigarettes anyway and switching to e-cigarettes was just one of many things they were doing. They were motivated and may have been using other aids like a patch or nicotine gum to help them quit.  To prove that e-cigarettes can help you quit smoking, you have to design a randomized controlled trial. With that type of design, you could make a strong causal argument as to whether e-cigarettes help you quit smoking. This study is an important step in the evidence base, but because of the design, it’s a limited step.  Where are you with regard to your own smoking studies?  We are recruiting now for the new ICanQuit.org study. This study will compare two different apps for smoking cessation and the goal is to determine the effectiveness of both apps.  We’re looking for adults who smoke at least five cigarettes a day who’d like to quit in the next 30 days. It’s a national study and is all online, so no blood draws, no driving to Fred Hutch. It’s really simple. We’re recruiting 2,000 people and each of them can earn up to $105 for participating.  We’re testing cutting-edge app technology. We’re integrating the latest in addiction science, the data we’ve gleaned from our prior research trials and the latest innovations in software technology and design to make the apps engaging and enjoyable and useful for consumers.  It’s a double-blind study so we can’t say what’s in the apps or how they’re different from each other. People will be randomly assigned, like a coin toss. But both apps use science-based techniques to help them quit smoking. It’s a win-win for participants.  Diane Mapes is a staff writer at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.

LETTER: No slow down of youth e-cigarette use during pandemic 
.W 
A new report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirms what many in public health have long feared, that despite the COVID pandemic, youth continue to use e-cigarettes in record numbers. Using 2021 data, the study found 2 million U.S. middle and high school students reported currently using e-cigarettes. Additionally, 85% of those youth reported using flavored e-cigarettes, with disposable e-cigarettes as the most popular. The epidemic of youth e-cigarette use did not go away. We’ve got a lot of work to do to turn these numbers around. E-cigarettes carry real health risks for young people. The nicotine in e-cigarettes can harm the developing adolescent brain, specifically the parts that control learning and memory. The SCA continues to educate youth about the harms of e-cigarette use, encouraging them to quit, and letting them know it is possible. One new resource for teens is the Live Vape Free text line – text “VAPEFREE” to 873373. The SCA also educates retailers about e-cigarettes and proper sales through the WI Wins program and witobaccocheck.org. For more on tobacco prevention and control efforts in Sauk County, follow SCA on Facebook.

Reported by Carl Quintanilla, the hour-long documentary explores the contentious debate over e-cigarettes. While some believe their sales should be restricted to prevent teens from vaping, others claim stricter regulation could cost the lives of many adult cigarette smokers who use e-cigarettes to help them quit. CNBC gets unprecedented access to Juul Labs, the upstart e-cigarette company whose innovative product design and marketing have made it the vaping industry leader. Quintanilla speaks with Juul executives about its remarkable growth as well as its reputation for making the most popular vaping products among adolescents. Among the most pressing concerns over vaping is its overwhelming popularity among teenagers, which critics attribute to the industry's shrewd exploitation of social media marketing, as well as a staggering array of enticing flavors. Quintanilla reports in-depth on the efforts of the government, parents and schools to stop vaping's explosive growth, and also profiles high school-aged vapers from across the country and a young social media influencer who says he earns his living by touting the 'cool' factor of e-cigarettes. Quintanilla's reporting takes him into the heart of the vaping epidemic in West Virginia. The state with the unfortunate distinction of having the nation's highest adult smoking rate also has a hard-earned expertise in respiratory illness stemming from its long experience with Black Lung Disease among coal miners. Researchers at West Virginia University are among the first to look holistically at vaping behavior, and offer substantial evidence in the case against e-cigarettes. Quintanilla also travels to London where the U.K. government openly promotes vaping as a means to stop adult smoking. A prominent researcher tells him that, in the absence of long-term human studies on e-cigarettes, smokers should opt for them to avoid the certain dangers of cigarettes. 'Vaporized: America's e-Cigarette Addiction' provides a timely guide to the vaping phenomenon. In compelling fashion, it explains how and why this highly addictive and controversial habit has become so big so fast.

ITC to resume cigarette production amid warning row 
.W 
New Delhi: India’s biggest cigarette maker ITC Ltd said it would resume production at its factories “consequent upon” a favorable court order, two weeks after it decided to shutter its plants over the government’s stringent new packaging rules.  India ordered that from April 1, 85 percent of a cigarette pack’s surface had to be covered in health warnings, up from 20 percent, but cigarette firms halted production saying the policy was not clear.  India’s $11 billion tobacco industry is up in arms against the new rules and has taken the government to court. Industry estimates show the production halt has already cost $850 million and risks the livelihood of millions of farmers.  In a statement to the Indian stock exchange late on Friday, ITC, part-owned by British American Tobacco, said: “Consequent upon a high court order passed in favor of the company, the company will soon resume manufacture of cigarettes in its factories”.  An ITC spokesman declined on Saturday to elaborate on ITC’s statement to the stock exchange. Its statement gave no details of its court appeal or any subsequent orders.  The company also did not address whether it would print bigger health warnings on its packs. ITC said earlier this month it was not ready to print bigger, “excessive” health warnings. It also said the government was implementing new rules despite a parliamentary panel report that called for the size of the warnings to be reduced.  But the panel’s report is not binding on the government, and health ministry officials have maintained that manufacturers must comply with the new rules.  Smoking kills more than 1 million people a year in India, according to BMJ Global Health. The World Health Organization says tobacco-related diseases cost the country $16 billion annually.

Body formed to spread awareness against tobacco use 
.W 
Rawalpindi - Pakistan National Heart Association constituted a special committee to spread awareness about harmful impact of smoking and to make the government realise that due to smoking, major class of society was suffering in our country. In this seminar, President PANAH Major Gen (R) Masud Kiani talked to media and said that 90% of the diseases were caused due to smoking. Approximately more than 5,000 people are admitted to hospitals and over 300 people died due to smoking on daily basis and according to a survey, by increasing prices of cigarettes, its consumption significantly reduced. Speakers in the seminar showed deep concerns about future of their children. Every year, 1,400 new children started smoking and number of girls starting smoking is greater than before. We strongly request the government to take steps for prevention of smoking and to make cigarettes out of reaches of people, especially children. The simple solution to this problem is that price of cigarettes is set so high that general public and children cannot purchase it, they said. This will also help to reduce expenditure incurred by government on health, they argued.

Kent smokers urged to take part in Stoptober as numbers rise in the pandemic 
.W 
Stoptober is back to launch its tenth mass quit attempt on October 1, calling on smokers in Kent to join the 2.3 million others who have tried to quit with the campaign since it launched a decade ago. Over six million adults in England still smoke, and it remains the leading cause of premature death, with almost 75,000 preventable deaths a year. 'Each cigarette fills our lungs with toxins which harm the immune system and leave us more vulnerable to infections' In Kent, figures for 2019 showed that 13.7% of residents smoked. Although this was a record low across the county, health experts fear numbers may have increased during the pandemic. Kent County Council’s Director for Public Health, Allison Duggal, said: “We know that the pandemic created lots of stressful and challenging situations and early indications show that people may have started or resumed smoking as a way of coping during the pandemic. "However, we also know the links between smoking and serious health implications if you get Covid as smoking damages the lungs and airways, making it harder to breathe. "Each cigarette fills our lungs with toxins which harm the immune system and leave us more vulnerable to infections.” She adds: “It’s never too late to quit – stopping smoking brings immediate benefits to health, including for people with an existing smoking-related disease. "Stoptober offers a range of free quitting support including the NHS Quit Smoking app while expert support from local One You Kent stop smoking services gives people the best chance of success. "GPs and pharmacists can also give advice and tips to help smokers quit, including what prescription medicines might be right for them. Find out more now at www.kent.gov.uk/stoptober” A new nationwide survey of 2,000 current smokers found that nearly half (45%) have been smoking more since the first lockdown began. Key reasons reported are being bored in the lockdowns (43%) or the pandemic making them more anxious (42%). "What’s more, data from the monthly UCL Smoking Toolkit Study indicates a large increase in smoking among the under-35s since the coronavirus pandemic, up from 18% in 2019 to 24% now. As a result of increased smoking behaviours, this year's Stoptober is more important than ever and is encouraging smokers to join the thousands of others who are giving quitting a go for the month of October, and getting to experience the benefits of giving up smoking including being able to start moving better, being able to breathe more easily and saving money. Stoptober offers a range of free quitting tools including: the NHS Quit Smoking app, Facebook messenger bot, Stoptober Facebook online communities, daily emails and SMS, and an online Personal Quit Plan. Susan Piddock, One You Kent’s Professional Lead for Stop Smoking, said: “We know it’s tough to quit smoking, but you don’t have to go it alone and you are more likely to succeed with our support. If you can quit for 28 days, you are five times more likely to quit for good so why not give it a go? “Our NHS trained smokefree advisers offer free, friendly support when you need it most, including free nicotine replacement therapy. "We’ve supported over 3000 smokers to quit over the past year. Stopping smoking is the best thing you can do for your health and Stoptober is an ideal opportunity to quit.” Information on Stoptober, along with online help, apps and ways to contact local One You Kent support services can be found at www.kent.gov.uk/stoptober
